# 1.1 - On foundations

## On autonomy

<!--
> *"I’m a warrior, so that my son may be a merchant, so that his son may be a poet."  -- John Quincy Adams [1767]*

- Bees don’t waste their time explaining to flies that flowers taste better than shit.
- Cutting off people who drained my energy. Reading more than I scrolled. Lifting weights instead of lifting burdens that weren’t mine. Choosing discipline over dopamine. And realizing this harsh truth: You don’t need more time. You need fewer distractions. Do that early and your life levels up ruthlessly fast.
- Don’t build your castle in other peoples kingdom’s

> *"A man is free at the instant he wants to be."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

Your autonomy is your major legacy.

Once you’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.

Stop being codependent of others and start caring for yourself first. The money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Hints:

- Telling your truth is not selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you be able to serve others to your fullest capacity.
- Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

> *"Care about other people think and you will always be their prisoner."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"If you begin by sacrificing yourself to those you love, you will end by hating those to whom you have sacrificed yourself."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"I can’t give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody."  
-- Herbert Swope [1882]*

> *"Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt."  
-- Nikos Kazantzakis [1883]*

-- E.E. Cummings [1894]*

> *"I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself."  
-- Rita Mae Brown [1944]*

-- Brené Brown [1965]*

> *"What we reason for ourselves may help others. What we reason for others will not help us." (...)  
"If you hurt people because of their expectations of you, that’s their problem."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On honesty
<!-- or authenticity!

- 5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction (integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)
- Core values: honesty everywhere. I dont want to be in place where I can’t be honest. I want to make relationships with a long term prospect. Flat hierarchy. I don’t want to be around hierarchical systems, I want to treat everybody as a peer. I don’t want to be around angry people.
- Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
- You are shaped by how you see others seeing you.
- tetris taught me that when you try to fit in, you’ll disappear.
-->

> *"When we see truth in a person we call it authenticity."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

Hints:

- If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate to you. Just be real, and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to excel at everything. Find your context.
- If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don’t need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.
- Honesty is an antidote to impostor syndrome.
- Truth is a better way to talk about ourselves. Personal branding will kill you. People justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.

-- Epictetus [0050]*

-- Judy Garland [1922]*

> *"Inside every cynical person, there is a disappointed idealist."  
-- George Carlin [1937]*

> *"Being honest may not get you a lot of friends but it’ll always get you the right ones."  
-- John Lennon [1940]*

> *"Always be radically honest, but use your honesty as a gift not as a weapon. Your honesty should benefit others."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Escape competition through authenticity." (...)  
"What the world craves is authenticity." (...)   
"To be honest speak without identity."
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Anything you loose by being real was fake."  
-- Kanye West [1977]* 

### On accountability

<!--
- every damn thing is your own fault, if you are any good.
- chi sei? sono l’evoluzione di tutti i miei errori.
- Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life. Part of being a man is getting shit done. A real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
- I approve of me. I take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax. Change your actions, not yourself. Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change. 
-->

> *"We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change."  
-- Katharine Hepburn [1907]*

You are your word.

Take responsibility. Only then you will cultivate respect for yourself and earn respect from others. Your choices have determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

-- Abraham Lincoln [1809]*

-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

> *"I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me."  
-- S.E. Hinton [1948]*

-->

-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life.

> *"If you worry about your reputation you don’t deserve to have one."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Your character starts out spotless. You can only stain it." (...)  
"The selfish reason to be ethical is that it attracts the other ethical people in the network." (...)  
"Integrity is when what you think and what you say and what you do are one." (...)  
"Returns are made on the way up. Reputations are made on the way down." (...)  
"Living a life of integrity pays off, but it takes a very long time." (...)  
"Before you can lie to another, you must firt lie to yourself." (...)  
"Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Fame is a lagging indicator of distinctiveness. Reputation is a lagging indicator of trustworthiness."  
-- x@rapahelz*






## On humility

<!--
- Humility With forward action: "I wasn’t the smartest in X but.."
- Never joke with your sources of income 
-->

> *"The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk."  
-- Cicero [-106]*

Modesty means being comfortable that others will discover your greatness.

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect, and you’ll never be. Success means nothing in life; it’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. On the other hand, your emotional health lives on for hundreds of generations in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

One way to humble yourself is to place yourself in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

> *"Do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself."  
-- Plutarch [0046]*

> *"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."  
-- Ernest Hemingway [1899]*

> *"Humility is mostly about being very honest about how much you owe to luck."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Virtue signaling is popular because it lets anyone, regardless of objective merit, go on an ego trip."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"The highest form of humility is being teachable."  
-- x@rapahelz*

> *"You learn more from other people if you pretend you know less than them."  
-- x@alexhormozi*

### On respect

<!--
- I roamed as a kid. Always respectful to people and places we were at. Now, kids are so badly mannered and have zero respect for people’s things- If I don’t respect him, I’ll disrespect him. Nothing in between..
-->

> *"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t."  
-- Bill Nye [1955]*

You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch but what you probably want is respect and admiration from your peers.

-- x@iamaaronwill*

### On gratitude

> *"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."  
-- Cicero [-106]*

You opened two gifts this morning: your eyes. Play the cards you are dealt. And sometimes you will be dealt bad cards.

Being grateful is looking up. Don’t forget that a group of people blazed the trail we’re enjoying, and another group continues to maintain it.

> *"The blind can’t see. The proud will not." (...)  
"The day a blind man sees, the first thing he throws away is the stick that has helped him all his life."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich." (...)

-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"Comparison is the thief of joy."  
-- Theodore Roosevelt [1858]*

> *"How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard."  
-- A.A. Milne [1882]*

> *"Feeling gratitude and not expressing it is like wrapping a present and not giving it."  
-- William Arthur Ward [1921]*

-- Bertolt Brecht [1898]*

> *"If you have a dream, don’t waste your energies explaining why."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

### On agency

<!--
+ x@signulll -- i’m not lazy, i just don’t want to hit my brain’s token limit for the day.

- As a man, never stay at home all day. Go out, make friends, and create new connections. A man's job is to face the world, take risks, and embrace difficulties.
- Chesterfield told his son in a 1754 letter that laziness is suicide by proxy, because by killing time you’re killing yourself. Dark but true
-->

> *"The most difficult is the decision to act, the rest is just tenacity."  
-- Andrea Earhart [1897]*

Hints:

- Help with a precise thing («I can drop a lasagna at 4:00.») instead of «I’m here for you». Helpful people don’t ask «how can I help». They just help.

- Without commitment, you’ll never start. Without consistency, you’ll never finish.
- You don’t need 100 self-help books, all you need is action + self-discipline.

"Inspiration is perishable. Act on it immediately."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"80% of what people call agency is trying the «dumb» solution and iterating from that. You can just do dumb things."  
-- x@farawaylaughtr*

### On ambition

<!--
- The ultimate question: Do you want you son/daughter to date someone like you?
- everything wants you when you want nothing
- If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?
-->
