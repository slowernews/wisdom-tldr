## The real you

<!--
There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul.
to be real you need to be vulnerable
- (kk) You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.
> *'Do you want to know who you are? Don’t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you.' -- Thomas Jefferson*
Entrepeneurs are curious
> *'You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*
> *'It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.' -- André Gide*
> *'That thing that made you weird as a kid could you make great as an adult — if you don’t lose it.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'Work to become, not to acquire.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be.' -- Alan Watts*

Your actions reveal your real values.

How you do anything is how you do everything. Ultimately you are your choices.

> *'All men die, but not every man lives' -- William Wallace*

> *'Weakness of attitude becomes weakness of character.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you’re a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you’re nobody-but-yourself.' --  E.E. Cummings*
  
### How to come alive?

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

> *'What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.' -- Confucius*

Never stop working on yourself. 

Is succeeding at mediocrity a worthwhile life? You must make the conscious decision that you are going to change your story. No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant if you develop an unshakable identity as a high achiever.

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Whatever you are, be a good one.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'Maybe who we are isn’t so much about what we do, but rather what we're capable of when we least expect it' -- Jodi Picoult*

## On happiness

<!--
- happiness is a state where nothing is missing. its a neutral state. positive thought normally implies a negative thought. just in our mind you are happy or unhappy. nature doesn't give a shit about it.
> *'What you get by achieving your goals is not as important as what you become by achieving your goals. At your funeral people will not recall what you did; they will only remember how you made them feel.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is “What might I be wrong about?”' -- Kevin Kelly*

- Money or wealth won‘t make you happy. Family, friends and purposful „work“ does.

> *'For every minute you are angry you lose sixty seconds of happiness.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*
> *'The rise is always better than the peak.' -- Jim Jefferies*
> *'The minute you’re satisfied with where you are, you aren’t there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*
> *'All the world is made of faith, and trust, and pixie dust.' -- J.M. Barrie*

- It’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn’t like ot climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.
- It’s quite liberating to understand reality as a construction.  
- High expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by top of hierarchy being more exposed.
- Anchor yourself -- remember who you are, the things you are good at, even when completely different thing. authentic self is a state
- Focus on internal fulfillment not external success
- Happiness is outside of my comfort zone.
- Love, sucess and happiness are a byproduct
- Persistence + Love = Abundance
- Regrets of the dying: Don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
- In the absence of such an outlet, masculine energy collapses. Men lose their sense of drive, purpose, and self-respect, and their standards, hardihood, and discipline atrophy. A slide into restlessness, vice, malaise, and outright depression is often the result.
- I’m a straight capitalist-meritocratist, entirely driven by gratitude.
- If you aren’t happy on the journey you won’t be happy at the destination.
- fazer links para quase todo o livro, se e introducao devia estar relacionado com o resto.
- The secret of joy is the mastery of pain. – Anaïs Nin

> *'Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.' --  Mahatma Gandhi*

Happiness comes from autonomy.

- Happiness = reality / expectations  
- Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy

Improve happiness actively (improve reality) and passively (lower expectations).

> *'Happiness is not a goal, it’s a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'Happiness is a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*

> *'Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.' -- Dale Carnegie*

> *'Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'Happiness is your default state when you remove everything.' -- Naval Ravikant*

> *'Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more.' -- Robert A. Heinlein*

### How to improve reality?

Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.  
We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability».

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.' -- Benjamin Disraeli*

### How to lower expectations?

Be [grateful](chapter_1_self.md#on-gratitude). If you have no expectations then you will easily exceed them.

> *'Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.' -- Pearl S. Buck*

> *'One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'I think and think and think, I‘ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.' -- Jonathan Safran Foer*
