No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant. Most won't.

There is no coming to consciousness without pain. To be real you need to be vulnerable. People will do anything to avoid facing their own soul. 

Your actions reveal your real values. Not what you say, not what you believe. How you do anything is how you do everything. You are your options. Ultimately you are your choices.

The ultimate question: Do you want you son/daughter to date someone like you?

Lying on death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you. The goal of life is contribution, not comfort.

- Passion is made not found. Instead of looking for your life’s purpose, look for things that will stretch you, engage you, and teach you.  
- Fear is your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.  
- Experience more things. Become unconfortable but when life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward.  
- The trouble with setting goals is that you're constantly working toward what you used to want.  
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.  
- Old keys won't open new doors.
- The things that scare you the most are the things you most need to do. Mitigate risks. Some people just have larger comfort zones.
- We say we try to get better but if look at your behaviour you'll see you actually are trying to to stay the same.
- Put your happiness before goals.
- Focus on financial freedom first.
- Pick one thing and stick with it to completion.

### How to find happiness?

Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.

Hints:

- amor fati. true wisdom comes from accepting fate.  
- Regrets of the dying: Don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.

- The richer you get the more expensive happiness becomes.  
- We only stay happy, productive and inspired when we uncover our true personality.  
- Doing what you like is freedom. liking what you do is happiness.
