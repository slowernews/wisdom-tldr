## The real you

> *"You are what you do, not what you say you’ll do."  
-- Carl Jung*

> *"You are the combination of your habits and the people who spend the most time with."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Do you want to know who you are? Don’t ask. Act! Action will delineate and define you."  
-- Thomas Jefferson*

You often feel tired, not because you have done too much but because you have done too little of what sparks a light in you. There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul. To be real you need to be vulnerable.

Your actions reveal your real values. Not what you say, not what you believe. How you do anything is how you do everything. You are your options. Ultimately you are your choices.

> *"How we spend our days is how we spend our lives."  
-- Annie Dillard*

-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."

-- William Wallace*

### How to come alive?

> *"Waking up to who you are requires letting go of who you imagine yourself to be."  
-- Alan Watts*

> *"Action expresses priorities."  
-- Mahatma Ghandi*

No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant. But you must make that decision. Most won't.

The ultimate question: Do you want you son/daughter to date someone like you?

> *"Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive."  
-- Howard Thurman*

> *"There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it will look good on your resume."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Whatever you are, be a good one."  
-- Abraham Lincoln*

> *"Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you’re a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you’re nobody-but-yourself."  
-- E.E. Cummings*

> *"You become what you think about all day long."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others."

-- Derek Sivers*

- do u want ur daughter to date somebody like u?
- old keys won't open new doors.
- “We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”
- Best Effort + Surrender = DESTINY
- The Things That Scare You the Most Are the Things You Most Need to Do. mitigate risks. some people just have larger comfort zones.
- we say we try to get better but if look at your behaviour you'll see you actually are trying to to stay the same.
1. Put Your Happiness Before Goals
4. Focus on Financial Freedom First
5. Pick One Thing and Stick With it to Completion

> *"Everyone tells you what to do and what’s good for you. They don’t want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs."  
-- Dan Millman*

The path will be revealed as you start walking.

Cancel your pity party, no one is coming to save you. Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life.

### How to design a life?

Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.

> *"The purpose of life is finding the largest burden that you can bear and bearing it."  
-- Jordan Peterson*

> *"If you plan on being less than you are capable of being, you will probably be unhappy all the days of your life."  
-- Abraham Maslow*

> *"Take advantage of the opportunities - that’s probably more important than charting your path."  
-- Admiral William Mcraven*

Lying on death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you. The goal of life is contribution, not comfort.

Hints:

- Passion is made not found. Instead of looking for your life’s purpose, look for things that will stretch you, engage you, and teach you.
- Fear is your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.  
- Experience more things. Become unconfortable but when life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.  

> *"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away."  
-- Pablo Picasso*

> *"Beware of overconcern for money, or position, or glory. Someday you will meet a man who cares for none of these things. Then you will know how poor you are."  
-- Rudyard Kipling*

> *"My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style"

-- Stewart Copeland*

-- Jean de La Fontaine*

> *"You meet your destiny on the road you take to avoid it."  
-- Carl Jung*

> *"You can, you should, and if you’re brave enough to start, you will."  
-- Stephen King*

> *"Don’t argue your path with other people. Walk it."  
-- Lazy Yogi*

> *"The question is not who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me."  
-- Ayn Rand*

> *"You have your way. I have my way. As for the right way, the correct way, and the only way, it does not exist."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *"Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving." (...)  
"Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is «master something, anything». Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"We know about quitting something that’s bad for you, or something you hate. But what about quitting something you love? I can tell you from experience, it leaves a lot of room for change. I still love everything I quit. But not as much as I love all this room for change."  
-- Derek Sivers*
