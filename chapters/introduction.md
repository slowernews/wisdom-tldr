## On the purpose of life

<!--
> *"A vida é a constante oscilação entre a ânsia de ter e o tédio de possuir."  -- Arthur Schopenhauer [1788]*
> *"You are not a drop in the ocean. You are the entire ocean in a drop."  -- Rumi [1207]*
-->

> *"The most extraordinary thing in the world is an ordinary man and an ordinary woman and their ordinary children."  
-- G.K. Chesterton [1874]*

> *"The meaning of life is to find your gift. The purpose of life is to give it away."  
-- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

Your job here on earth is to make a few life decisions extremely well, and the rest is a rounding error.

> *"When a person can’t find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure."  
-- Victor Frankl [1905]*

> *"Of course life has no point. If it had, man would not be free."  
-- Andrei Tarkovsky [1932]*

> *"The purpose of life is finding the largest burden that you can bear and bearing it."

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

## On happiness

<!--
- alcançar a liberdade: ou c muito dinheiro ou c falta de desejos.
- If they are not in front of you, leave them behind. Transactional friendships decrease your happiness.
- Men give up happyness for their family. Women give up family for their happyness.
- You are happy because you are surrounded by people you trust and love. You are healthy because you are in control of your impulses and habits. You are wealthy because you started investing long-term decades ago. You are relaxed because you are in control of your time.
- You don’t hear much from happy people, because once you are living the life you want, you keep a low profile, you keep your life private.
-->

> *"Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi [1869]*

Happiness is a mind state where nothing is missing.

	HAPPINESS = AUTONOMY + BELONGING + MASTERY  and  REALITY > EXPECTATIONS

> *"Happiness is not a destination but a state of being."  
-- Demetrius of Phalerum [-350]*

> *"Happiness is not a goal, it’s a byproduct."  
-- Eleanor Roosevelt [1884]*

> *"Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get."  
-- Dale Carnegie [1888]*

### How to find happiness?

> *"The secret of happiness is freedom and the secret of freedom is courage."  
-- Thucydides [-460]*

Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.

Hints:

- Regrets of the dying: don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
- Happiness is outside of your comfort zone.
- We only stay happy, productive and inspired when we uncover our true personality. Focus on internal fulfillment not external success.
- I’m a straight capitalist-meritocratist, entirely driven by gratitude. The richer you get the more expensive happiness becomes.
- Busy people are happier. They don't have time to overthink.
- Amor fati. True wisdom comes from accepting fate. High expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by the top of hierarchy being more exposed.

## Who are you now?

<!--

> *"It isn’t what we say or think that defines us, but what we do."  -- Jane Austen [1775]*
> *"I have already lost touch with a couple of people I used to be."  -- Joan Didion [1934]*
-->

> *"You are the combination of your habits and the people who you spend the most time with."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Your actions reveal your real values. Not what you say, not what you believe. How you do anything is how you do everything. You are your options. Ultimately you are your choices.

A big part of who you are is who you’re not.

> *"Day by day, what you choose, what you think and what you do is who you become."

### On finding your path

<!--
+ naval@x -- All the great questions have only personal answers.
+ naval@x -- Only two things are pursued for their own sake - even if they make you feel worse or make you worse off - truth and love.
+ naval@x -- Three decisions determine 90% of your life outcomes: who you're with, what you do, and where you live.

- life is not about finding yourself. life is about creating yourself.
- Better to admit you walked to the wrong door than spend your life in the wrong room.
- It’s not the lack of intelligence, it’s the lack of focus that is stopping you.
- the biggest comeback is making yourself feel like yourself again.
- The longer you are living on autopilot, the harder the future is going to be.

> *"In order to live free and happily, you must sacrifice boredom. It is not always an easy sacrifice."  
-- Richard Bach [1936]*

Your new life will cost you your old one. Do not fear your own potential.

No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant. Most won’t. There is no coming to consciousness without pain. To be real you need to be vulnerable and we do anything to avoid facing our own soul. 

You are not behind, you are on a different path.

The path will be revealed as you start walking. Cancel your pity party, no one is coming to save you. Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life. You may not be where you want to be, but thank god you’re not where you use to be.

Hints:

- Passion is made not found. Instead of looking for your life’s purpose, experience more and look for things that will stretch you, engage you, and teach you.
- Fear is your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track. The things that scare you the most are the things you most need to do. Mitigate risks. Some people just have larger comfort zones.
- Become unconfortable but when life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward. Pick one thing and stick with it to completion.
- The trouble with setting goals is that you’re constantly working toward what you used to want. Old keys won’t open new doors.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.
- We say we try to get better but if look at your behaviour you’ll see you actually are trying to to stay the same.
- Focus on financial freedom first. Put your happiness before goals.

But if he has the imagination, he will turn around and Fate will point out to him what fork in the road he should take. If he has the guts, he will take it."
