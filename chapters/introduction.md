## Who are you?

> *"You are the combination of your habits and the people who you spend the most time with."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Your actions reveal your real values. Not what you say, not what you believe. How you do anything is how you do everything. You are your options. Ultimately you are your choices.

A big part of who you are is who you're not.

Your new life will cost you your old one. Do not fear your own potential.

-- E.E. Cummings*

-- Alan Watts*

> *"In order to live free and happily, you must sacrifice boredom. It is not always an easy sacrifice."  
-- Richard Bach*

No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant. Most won't. There is no coming to consciousness without pain. To be real you need to be vulnerable and we do anything to avoid facing our own soul.

-- Howard Thurman*

> *"There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it will look good on your resume."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Whatever you are, be a good one."  
-- Abraham Lincoln*

## On finding your path

> *"Everyone tells you what to do and what’s good for you. They don’t want you to find your own answers. They want you to believe theirs."  
-- Dan Millman*

You are not behind, you are on a different path.

The path will be revealed as you start walking. Cancel your pity party, no one is coming to save you. Pull yourself together and take total ownership for everything in your life. You may not be where you want to be, but thank god you're not where you use to be.

Hints:

- Passion is made not found. Instead of looking for your life’s purpose, experience more and look for things that will stretch you, engage you, and teach you.
- Fear is your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track. The things that scare you the most are the things you most need to do. Mitigate risks. Some people just have larger comfort zones.
- Become unconfortable but when life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward. Pick one thing and stick with it to completion.
- The trouble with setting goals is that you're constantly working toward what you used to want. Old keys won't open new doors.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.
- We say we try to get better but if look at your behaviour you'll see you actually are trying to to stay the same.
- Focus on financial freedom first. Put your happiness before goals.

"Copying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end." (...)  
"Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is «master something, anything». Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is." (...)  
"There should be at least one thing in your life you enjoy despite being no good at it. This is your play time, which will keep you young. Never apologize for it."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day."

## On happiness

> *"Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi*

-- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *"Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get."

### How to find happiness?

Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.

Hints:

- Regrets of the dying: don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
- Happiness is outside of your comfort zone.
- We only stay happy, productive and inspired when we uncover our true personality. Focus on internal fulfillment not external success.
- I’m a straight capitalist-meritocratist, entirely driven by gratitude. The richer you get the more expensive happiness becomes.
- Amor fati. True wisdom comes from accepting fate. High expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by the top of hierarchy being more exposed.
