## The real you

<!--
There is no coming to consciousness without pain. People will do anything, no matter how absurd, in order to avoid facing their own soul.
to be real you need to be vulnerable
- (kk) You are what you do. Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on.

> *'It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not.' -- André Gide*

Your actions reveal your real values.

How you do anything is how you do everything. Ultimately you are your choices.

> *'Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you’re a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you’re nobody-but-yourself.' --  E.E. Cummings*
  
### How to come alive?

> *'Don’t ask yourself what the world needs, ask yourself what makes you come alive and go do that. Because what the world needs is more people to come alive.' -- Howard Thurman*

> *'What the superior man seeks is in himself; what the small man seeks is in others.' -- Confucius*

Never stop working on yourself. 

Is succeeding at mediocrity a worthwhile life? You must make the conscious decision that you are going to change your story. No matter where you are in your life, you have the power to change everything in an instant.

> *'There comes a time when you ought to start doing what you want. Take a job that you love. You will jump out of bed in the morning. I think you are out of your mind if you keep taking jobs that you don’t like because you think it will look good on your resume.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Whatever you are, be a good one.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

## On finding your path

<!--
> *'You are given the gift of life in order to discover what your gift «in» life is. You will complete your mission when you figure out what your mission is. This is not a paradox. This is the way.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity' -- Albert Einstein*
- (kk) Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.
- (kk) Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.

1. Put Your Happiness Before Goals
2. Fulfillment is Dependent on Direction
3. Pain is a Messenger
4. Focus on Financial Freedom First
5. Pick One Thing and Stick With it to Completion
	
> *'Everything tells me that I am about to make a wrong decision, but making mistakes is just part of life. What does the world want of me? Does it want me to take no risks, to go back to where I came from because I didn’t have the courage to say "yes" to life?' -- Paulo Coelho*

“Your Ten-Year Plan for a Remarkable Life”. in 2027 how a day of your life will look like? write how will look this day. dream big. write it with no fear and read it once a year. these things can make a difference. exercise: what would be your life if you wouldnt have fear of failure of life.

- Most people continue to chase down their ever elusive “calling”. You know, that one thing that if they do not do it, they have wasted their entire life and skillsets on trivial activities and distractions. Allow me to share a little secret with you. This doesn’t exist.
- Most of the entrepreneurs I know love what they do, but they do not love it because they feel it is their life’s purpose. So instead of looking for your life’s purpose, look for things that will stretch you, engage you, and teach you. challenge Because that is where you will find true fulfillment and satisfaction. Create Projects, Not Goals
- Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success. You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it. Without this clarity, you will find yourself wandering aimlessly for years, or even decades of your life and looking back, wishing that you’d had more direction.
- We know about quitting something that’s bad for you, or something you hate. But what about quitting something you love? I can tell you from experience, it leaves a lot of room for change. I still love everything I quit. But not as much as I love all this room for change._sivers
- Most 16 year olds are just using their phones to send silly snaps to their friends and watch porn. And most people waste their lives away in 9-5 jobs. It’s not an age thing.
- “We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”
- When you look at your bank account and don’t like what you see, you need to remember that these results were caused by your thoughts. They were caused by your beliefs, your decisions, and your values that were then projected into your reality.
- DO THE WORK: Work until your idols become your rivals. Work hard in silence. Let your silence be your noise. How much time do you consume vs produce? Are you watching others do things you could be doing if you weren’t watching them.

What do you really want?
- What do the actions of your past suggest is most important to you?
- What desires do you have that don’t align with your past behavior.
- What future path does your past behavior suggest rather than your imagination?
- If you don’t like these answers, change your existing behavior.

### How to design a life?

Lying on death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you. Mediocrity, as a goal, sucks. As a result, is OK.

The goal of life is not comfort it’s contribution. Society has tried to convince us that the ultimate goal of our lives is to increase our comfort.
But the problem with this philosophy is that no great work ever came from comfort.

> *'Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced.' -- Soren Kierkegaard*

Hints:

- Instead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change. It’s ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they also motivate you. Especially if they become well enough known that people start to identify them with you. You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that category.  
- If you are feeling lost in life experience more things. Become unconfortable. It will improve your tolerance for risk and adversity. Almost everything that you want is on the other side of the uncomfortable and the scary.  
- Let fear be your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.  
- What do you do for fun? What are you interested in that everybody in the world is interested in?  
- Go where you can make a difference not where you think there’s a home run.  
- When life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.  
- Passion is made not found.  
- There’s a fable of a man stuck in a flood. Convinced that God is going to save him, he says no a passing canoe, boat, and helicopter that offer to help. He dies, and in heaven asks God why He didn’t save him. God says, “I sent you a canoe, a boat, and a helicopter!” That’s why you need to re-evaluate your old dreams to see if new means have come along. Don’t let the details distract you from your goal.

## On happiness

> *'The rise is always better than the peak.' -- Jim Jefferies*
> *'The minute you’re satisfied with where you are, you aren’t there anymore.' -- Tony Gwynn*

- Money or wealth won‘t make you happy. Family, friends and purposful „work“ does.
- Regrets of the dying: Don’t ignore your dreams; don’t work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.
- It’s a mountain of a dream and a mile-high climb to the top. And what it took me a long time to discover is that I didn’t like ot climb much. I just liked to imagine the summit.
- It’s quite liberating to understand reality as a construction.  
- High expectations make you miserable, expectations nowadays are more and more triggered by top of hierarchy being more exposed.
- Anchor yourself -- remember who you are, the things you are good at, even when completely different thing. authentic self is a state
- Focus on internal fulfillment not external success
- Happiness is outside of my comfort zone.
- Persistence + Love = Abundance
- Masculine energy collapses. Men lose their sense of drive, purpose, and self-respect, and their standards, hardihood, and discipline atrophy. A slide into restlessness, vice, malaise, and outright depression is often the result.

> *'Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.' --  Mahatma Gandhi*

Happiness is a state where nothing is missing. Only in our mind you are happy or unhappy - nature doesn't care.

- Happiness = reality / expectations  
- Happy life = mastery + belonging + autonomy

Improve happiness actively (improve reality) and passively (lower expectations).

> *'Happiness is not a goal, it’s a byproduct.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'Happiness is a journey, not a destination.' -- Ben Sweetland*

> *'Success is getting what you want. Happiness is wanting what you get.' -- Dale Carnegie*

> *'Happiness in intelligent people is the rarest thing I know.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'Happiness is your default state when you remove everything.' -- Naval Ravikant*

> *'Happiness consists in getting enough sleep. Just that, nothing more.' -- Robert A. Heinlein*

### How to improve reality?

Act, be patient and break long term goals into smaller ones so you can enjoy the journey.  
We derive our true sense of fulfillment from constantly pursuing a life of «uncomfortability». For that you need autonomy.

> *'We have the idea that comfort brings happiness. Happiness comes from not having fear.'*

> *'Action may not always bring happiness, but there is no happiness without action.' -- Benjamin Disraeli*

### How to lower expectations?

Be [grateful](chapter_1_self.md#on-gratitude). Low expectations mean you will easily exceed them.

> *'Many people lose the small joys in the hope for the big happiness.' -- Pearl S. Buck*

> *'One of the keys to happiness is a bad memory.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'I think and think and think, I‘ve thought myself out of happiness one million times, but never once into it.' -- Jonathan Safran Foer*
