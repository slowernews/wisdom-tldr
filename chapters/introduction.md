> *"The purpose of life is finding the largest burden that you can bear and bearing it."

Lying on death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you. The goal of life is contribution, not comfort.

Hints:

- Fear is your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.  
- Experience more things. Become unconfortable but when life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.
