Your autonomy is your major legacy.

Once we’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.
  
Stop being codependent or others and start caring for yourself first. The money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Telling *your* truth is not being selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you are able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

> *"That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second."*

> *"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

## On authenticity

<!--
- i don't wnat to be in environments or people where i have to watch what i say. -- naval
- everybody wants spirituality. nobody wants the truth. -- naval
- if you tell teh truth you don't need to reharse anything
- core values: honesty everywhere. i dont want to be in place where i cant be honest. i want to make relationships with a long term prospect. flat hierarchy. i dont want to be around hierarchical systems. i want to treat everybody as a peer. angry. i dont want to be around angry people
- Personal branding will kill you. Personal DOING will save everyone around you. people justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.

> *"I'd rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not."  
-- Kurt Cobain*

> *"When we see truth in a person we call it authenticity."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don't need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.

If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate with you. Just be real and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to be great at everything. Find your context. You don’t need to suceed in every context.

## On respect

<!--
- you might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch. but what you probably want is respect and admiration- the psychology of money
- virtue signaling is popular because it let anyone, regardless of objective merit, go on an ego trip. -- naval
-->

> *"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t."  
-- Bill Nye*

Don't forget that a group of people blazed the trail we’re enjoying and that another group continues to maintain it.

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect neither you'll ever be. Success means nothing in life. It’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. Your emotional health, by the other hand, lives for hundreds of generations after in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

> *"Promptness is a sign of respect."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."

### How to apologise?

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

> *"It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request."

### How to humble yourself?

A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

# 1.2 - On growth

-->

> *"If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

You can choose courage or comfort but you can’t choose both.

The size of your life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable you are willing to be. You keep doing what you’re good at to avoid facing the real problems in your life. Breaking rules frightens people but comfort is the enemy of achievement. You’ll never get what you want in life without risk. Risk over safety is the way to pull forward. If you act average, you’re going to be average. To outperform, you must be different *and* correct.

Hints:

- Risk looks different for everyone.
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you'd expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.
- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week. Being uncomfortable should be “play” for you. Get confort in disconfort.
- Risk prone is better than risk averse but dont allow to be out of the game. Adventure comes from percieved risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can build up to the scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.
- This isn’t a success strategy. This is a WELL-BEING strategy. The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time.

Experience and analysis of past situations. Deliberated practice and structured knowledge.

Hints:

- Listen to someone explaining some hard techniques and then try to follow the advice. Get feedback. It accelerates learning.
- If it’s easy, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and have a hard time. Now you’re learning.
- Reflect on your mistakes, try to find what cues you missed and what you should look for next time.
- Repeat.

What are you really holding onto that is holding you back. 2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle. 3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life?

- Don’t waste time on more than learning more than a handful of conjugations for primarily first-person singular (I) and second-person singular (you) in the past, present, and future tenses, along with common phrases that illustrate them. Throw in a few auxilaries (to want to V, to need to V, to like to V, etc.) Make it your goal to screw up as often as possible in uncontrolled environments. Explicitly ask friends to correct you and reward them with thanks and praise when they catch you spouting nonsense, particularly the small understandable mistakes. !!! Before you invest (or waste) hundreds and thousands of hours on a language, you should deconstruct it. !!! learn language: films, manga, phrasebook, dictionary, flashcards. Consider a new language like a new sport. analogy. advantages and train. learn conjugations for “helping” verbs like “to want,” “to need,” “to have to,” “should,” etc. In Spanish and many others, this allows you to express yourself with “I need/want/must/should” + the infinite of any verb. Learning the variations of a half dozen verbs gives you access to all verbs. This doesn’t help when someone else is speaking, but it does help get the training wheels off self-expression as quickly as possible. The apple is red. It is John’s apple. I give John the apple. I give John the apple. We give him the apple. He gives it to John. She gives it to him. I must give it to him. I want to give it to her.

### Improving by analysis

> *"Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience."  
-- Otto von Bismarck*

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t make new. New comes from having a broader perspective and analysis of past situations. People repeat very easily the same mistakes. You improve by examining your failures, it will help you letting go.

> *"You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward."
-- Unknown*

> *"Journal early before your inhibitions take in. Keep a journal to record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want."*

### Applied knowledge

> *"Knowledge without action is useless. «Pathological learners» who are voracious consumers of knowledge live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it."*

Action, not knowledge, leads to success. If you are not constantly taking action on the new information that you are learning then it’s just educational porn.

> *"Seek knowledge. Knowledge and courage are the elements of greatness. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile."  
-- Balthasar Gracian*

> *"The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge."

There’s always room for improvement, be humble. There is no place for a «prima donna».

If you’re not getting better today, you’re getting worse. Skills are perishable and the path to mastery a never ending story. Some of the skills that you need to achieve expertise were not yet systemised.

## On habits and systems

<!--
- Personality is malleable, in fact it’s so malleable we often don’t realize we’re forging a new one.
- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others. Annual review: GOOD + BAD: Health & Fitness, Business & Career, Finances, relationships, personal growth	
- Shut off all work and electronics at least 2 hours before you want to go to sleep, sit down with a pen and a notepad and write down everything that you need to achieve the following day in order of importance. write 1000 words every morning before you do anything else. Learn how to say no, or not to say yes. One new thing: learn at least one new thing everyday. Read, watch a documentary, look around, observe, engage in a conversation. Be creative: Creativity conquers jealousy, envy, self-pity and worry. 52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything. e.g. water, blueberries, green tea, avocados, leafy green vegetables, fatty fish, water, dark chocolate, flax seeds and nuts

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
-- Will Durant*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits. Habits are compound interest in real life.

Consistency doesn’t come from effort, it comes from showing up. Long term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life. 

> *"At any given time, I'm either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential."  
-- Winston Churchill*

> *"First we make our habits, then our habits make us."  
-- Charles C. Nobel*

### How to change habits?

> *"Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things."  
-- Charles Duhigg*

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.  

Hints:

- Try to break a bad habit and form a good one every 6 months. (Naval Ravikant)
- Avoid low leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and negative bias), pointless notifications, social media (use it as an output not as entertainment. Other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning nor the last thing you see at night), own a TV, work long hours, bad relationships, judge, control of petty stuff, perfectionism, signaling virtue. 
- Cultivate high leverage habits: cultivating useful skills, exercise, rest, medidtation, travel, read, journal, music, create, network and make friends, time outside with friends & family, massage, gratefulness, forgive, self awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, sleep/nap, smile, use colors. 
- Small steps beat big dreams: the smaller the change the more likely you’ll actually make it. “Could I meditate for 15 minutes? No, I feel resistance, I’m not gonna do it. Okay, five? Huh, I don’t feel resistance to that. I feel like I can do it for five.”
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making a pact with someone to introduce financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to solidify new habits.
- Don't try to be perfect. Two vices is too much, none makes you boring.
- Pay attention, correct and don’t judge.

- Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction. -- m manson
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.

> *"If you are depressed you are living in the past.   
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present."  
-- Lao Tzu*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

-  Depression (under-stimulation) is the lack of self-expression. If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed to estimulate yourself. 
-  Anxiety (over-stimulation) creates hypersensitivity. Linked with our evolutionarily need of control. Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Nothing is gained by worrying about «not knowing». We don’t control anything, at most we influence some stuff. Stress is caused by giving a fuck. Worry is a misuse of the imagination. Past is only in your head. What’s important is present and future.

### How to overcome them?

> *"If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play."  
-- Jason Nemer*

Action cures everything. Physical stress avoids need for control.

Hustling (right amount of stimulation) is to be always stretching comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.  

Hints:

- Best antidepressant is knowing we matter to others. People do not die from suicide, they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to diminish the need of control. If you are feeling stressed out.. breathe. Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance. People are naturally happier when kept busy.
- Diet is also relevant: debug your body as much as you can.

## On fear, anger and excuses

<!--
- What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown. fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.

> *"A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears."  
-- Montaigne*
-->

> *"We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light."  
-- Plato*

Fear is paralyzing.

When you view everything through the lens of fear, you'll tend to stay in retreat mode. Anger and excuses are fear clothed. All excuses are refutable. The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own - do not blame them on your family, the ecology, or the president. Living reality requires less energy than victim constiousness. Escaping reality sucks your energy.

> *"Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

### How to overcome fear?

> *"We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them."  
-- Christian Nestell Bovee*

Replace fear with curiosity.

Hints:

- The best antidote to fear is aceptance not courage.
- Conquering fear means defining fear. Define your fears not your goals.

> *"It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves."  
-- Sir Edmund Hillary*

### On courage

<!--
- courage is a form of intelligence not strenght. it's about outwitting your limiting beliefs, irrational fears and insecurities.
“Without courage there cannot be truth, and without truth there can be no other virtue.” -- Sir Walter Scott
“Courage charms us, because it indicates that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world, that he is thinking neither of his bed, nor his dinner, nor his money, but will venture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind.” -- Ralph Waldo Emerson
“A man without courage is a knife without an edge.” -- Proverb
“Courage consists, not in blindly overlooking danger, but in seeing and conquering it.” -- Jean Paul
“All brave men love; for he only is brave who has affections to fight for.” -- Nathaniel Hawthorne
“Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear — not absence of fear.” -- Mark Twain
“Courage is grace under pressure.” -- Ernest Hemingway
“Courage is doing what you are afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you are scared.” -- Eddie Rickenbacker
“To see what is right and not to do it, is want of courage.” -- Confucius
“No man can be brave who considers pain the greatest evil of life.” -- Cicero
“Courage ought to be guided by skill, and skill armed by courage.” -- Sir P. Sidney
“Courage makes a man more than himself; for he is then himself plus his valor.” -- William R. Alger
“A man of courage is also full of faith.” -- Cicero
“So far as man stands for anything, and is productive or originative at all, his entire vital function may be said to have to deal with maybes. Not a victory is gained, not a deed of faithfulness or courage is done, except upon a maybe; not a service, not a sally of generosity, not a scientific exploration or experiment or textbook, that may not be a mistake. It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all.”
William James
“It is courage that vanquishes in war, and not good weapons.” -- Miguel de Cervantes
“He has not learned the lesson of life who does not every day surmount a fear.” -- Ralph Waldo Emerson
“Man is loved mainly because of two virtues: courage first, loyalty second.” -- Gaius Lucilius
“A coward flees backward, away from new things. A man of courage flees forward, in the midst of new things.” -- Jacques Maritain
“He who loses wealth loses much; he who loses a friend loses more; but he that loses his courage loses all.” -- Miguel de Cervantes
“Troops would never be deficient in courage, if they could only know how deficient in it their enemies were.” -- Duke of Wellington
“The boldest measures are the safest.” -- Horatio Nelson
“Tell a man that he is brave, and you help him become so.” -- Thomas Carlyle
“Keep your fears to yourself but share your courage with others.” -- Robert Louis Stevenson
“The scars you acquire by exercising courage will never make you feel inferior.” -- Giovanni Battista Cima
“Knowledge without courage is sterile.” -- Baltasar Gracián

## On failure, mistakes and regrets

<!--
“There are only two kinds of people who fail: those who listen to nobody . . . and those who listen to everybody.” -- Thomas Beshere, Jr.

- (kk) To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
- (kk) When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.
- there is no failure, only feedback. -- naval
- most of our suffering comes from avoidance. -- naval
-->

> *"Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

Fail fast and bounce back quickly: sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.

Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax. 

> *"Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment."  
-- Jim Horning*

> *"We're even wrong about which mistakes we're making."  
-- Carl Winfeld*

> *"If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one."  
-- Elbert Hubbard*

-- Lou Holtz*

> *"It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk*

### On regrets

> *"A life spent making mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful, than a life spent doing nothing."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

Be gentle first with yourself. Don't punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you. Don’t ever regret anything because regretting means wanting to forget every moment. Every moment is what makes you who you are today.

> *"Sorrow is better than fear. Fear is a journey, a terrible journey. But, sorrow is at least an arriving."  
-- Alan Paton*

> *"It’s not just other people we need to forgive. Sometimes we need to forgive ourselves."  
-- Mitch Albom*

> *"You’re going to make mistakes in life. It’s what you do after the mistakes that counts."  
-- Brandi Chastain*

> *"Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."  
-- Mary Oliver*

Suffering is a temporary but essential part of life. Making mistakes is better than faking perfections. Every difficulty carries with it a corresponding opportunity of equal size.

> *"Your pain, is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding."  
-- Kahil Gibran*

> *"Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars."  
-- Kahlil Gibran*

> *"A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole."  
-- China Mieville*

## On shame, confidence and validation

<!--
- money problems are self-confidence problems.
- to get self aceptance you have to do the unconfortable things that you know you are right.
- It's a sign of great inner security to be hostile to the unfamiliar
- we hold on to something so tight because we fear something so great won't happen twice.
- everythng you're running away is in your head.
- generally the thing you're most ashamed of is actually your biggest strenght/asset but you haven't figured out how to use it.
-->

> *"Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."  
-- Brene Brown*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide. The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings compensate physical & mental insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure.

### On confidence and validation

<!--
> *"Self-confidence is the memory of success."  
-- David Storey*
- amazing how not being insecure about an unattractive quality instantly makes you way more attractive.
“Those whose approval you seek the most give you the least.” --Rozanne Weissman

- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
- self-esteem is just the REPUTATION you have with yourself. you'll always know. -- naval
- guilt is society's voice speaking in your head. -- naval
- confidence come from some success. you need some accomplishment to get there.
-->

> *"Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes."  
-- Leo Buscaglia*

Confidence is the opposite of shame. Confidence is shamelessness. 

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Your need for aceptance can make you invisible in this world. Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.

> *"Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction."  
-- Bobby Sommer*

> *"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence."  
-- Charles Bukowski*

### How to overcome shame and grow confidence?

> *"Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."  
-- Tyrion*

Hiding creates shame so the cure for shame is honesty. Honesty is the pathway to confidence.

When hiding something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it.

Hints:

- When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets. Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech. If you don’t believe you are good, you'll never be good.
- It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- Confidence markers: the space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel. Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked. The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.

> *"Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them."  
-- Augusten Burroughs*

> *"If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless."  
"Ignore what others may be thinking of you, because they aren’t."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The less confident you are, the more serious you have to act."  
-- Tara Ploughman*

> *"You've gotta dance like there’s nobody watching."  
-- William W. Purkey*

> *"Just get out of the room."  
-- Robert Glover*

### On entitlement

> *"Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity."  
-- Amy Cuddy*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, being jealous and insecure does.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody so I deserve special treatment.  
- I’m worse than everybody so I deserve special treatment.

> *"Don’t be so humble - you are not that great."  
-- Golda Meir*






---
## On limits and motivation

<!--
- believe it and it will be doesn't always work - there are limits to our belief.
- what limits individuals is the inability to confront reality, to see things for what they truly are.
-->

> *"We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training."  
-- Archilochus*

Your limits are defined by your fears.  

Impostor syndrome: your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. We live in a society where the greatest lies that are told are the ones that we tell ourself. There are few actual rules. The police aren’t coming for you. No one is watching you. Do what you want.

> *"To define is to limit."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

### How to get motivation and break through your resistances?

Lazyness is resting before getting tired.

Most people keep telling themselves old stories and patterns that aren’t serving them.

- Don’t be afraid of taking a step back.  
- Break down your dreams/goals into achievable steps.  
- Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation.

However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

Hints:

- Don’t look for inspiration. Look for irritation.
- Sometimes is a matter of money. Sometimes is a matter of «burning bridges»

> *"With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how»."  
-- Tony Robbins*

> *"There was a gun to my head. The gun was, I didn’t want to be in an assisted living home, watching TV all day, waiting to die. Every day I wake up with that gun to my head. Every day I live."*






---
## On pessimism

<!--
> *"Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. The honest way to critique is to create the alternative."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
- to see if they really think that things are getting worse, ask them if they'd rather live in the future or in the past. -- naval
- the seduction of pessimism: optimism sounds like a sales pitch. pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
- organisms that treat threats as more urgent than oportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.
- entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic beacuse they are rewarded by being optimistic. Intelectuals for being pessimistic.
-->

> *"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."  
-- William Arthur Ward*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

Optimism is rarely the way but pessimism is never the way. Anyway, on the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

> *"That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be."  
-- James Jones*

> *"A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty."  
-- Bertram Carr*

> *"There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, ‘Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,’ and an optimist who says, ‘Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way.’ Either way, nothing happens."  
-- Yvon Chouinard*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you derive success. From perfection you derive procastination, anxiety and depression. 

It's liberating to see yourself as a «doist».

> *"Think of your life merely as a long sequence of actions and decisions. If you’re like most people, many of these actions and decisions are sub-optimal. And what most of us mean when we say we’d like to “change” ourselves is simply that we’d like to make slightly more optimal actions and decisions. Keep your “self” out of your decisions, because most likely, it’s not about “you”. Simply ask yourself, “Is this a good thing to do?” Yes? Then go do it."  
-- Mark Manson*

-- Maria Shriver*
