# 1.1 - On foundations

## On autonomy

<!--
> *"I’m a warrior, so that my son may be a merchant, so that his son may be a poet."  -- John Quincy Adams [1767]*
> *"Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you’re a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you’re nobody-but-yourself."  -- E.E. Cummings [1894]*

- Bees don’t waste their time explaining to flies that flowers taste better than shit.
- Cutting off people who drained my energy. Reading more than I scrolled. Lifting weights instead of lifting burdens that weren’t mine. Choosing discipline over dopamine. And realizing this harsh truth: You don’t need more time. You need fewer distractions. Do that early and your life levels up ruthlessly fast.
- Don’t build your castle in other peoples kingdom’s
- Freedom to -> freedom from -- naval
- when you don’t want to be interesting you are free. -- moojy
-->

> *"A man is free at the instant he wants to be."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

Your autonomy is your major legacy.

Once you’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.

Stop being codependent of others and start caring for yourself first. The money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Hints:

- Telling *your* truth is not selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you be able to serve others to your fullest capacity.
- Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

> *"Care about other people think and you will always be their prisoner."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

/> *"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"If you begin by sacrificing yourself to those you love, you will end by hating those to whom you have sacrificed yourself."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"I can’t give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody."  
-- Herbert Swope [1882]*

> *"Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt."  
-- Nikos Kazantzakis [1883]*

> *"I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself."  
-- Rita Mae Brown [1944]*

> *"Freedom is not the absence of commitments, but the ability to choose and commit myself to what is best for me."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

> *"Never explain: your friends do not need it, and your enemies will not believe you anyway."  
-- Elbert Hubbard [1856]*

> *"If you do not take risks for your opinion, you are nothing." (...)  
"Never never compromise. Say it the way it is."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second."  
-- Brené Brown [1965]*

> *"What we reason for ourselves may help others. What we reason for others will not help us." (...)  
"If you hurt people because of their expectations of you, that’s their problem."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

## On honesty

> *"No legacy is so rich as honesty."  
-- William Shakespeare [1564]*

> *"The man to lies to himself can be more easily offended than any other."  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky [1821]*

> *"Always be radically honest, but use your honesty as a gift not as a weapon. Your honesty should benefit others."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On authenticity

<!--
- 5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction (integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)
- Core values: honesty everywhere. I dont want to be in place where I can’t be honest. I want to make relationships with a long term prospect. Flat hierarchy. I don’t want to be around hierarchical systems, I want to treat everybody as a peer. I don’t want to be around angry people.
- Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
- You are shaped by how you see others seeing you.
- tetris taught me that when you try to fit in, you’ll disappear.
-->

> *"It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."  
-- André Gide [1869]*

> *"When we see truth in a person we call it authenticity."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Anything you loose by being real was fake."  
-- Kanye West [1977]* 

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

Hints:

- If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate to you. Just be real, and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to excel at everything. Find your context.
- If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don’t need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.
- Honesty is an antidote to impostor syndrome.
- Truth is a better way to talk about ourselves. Personal branding will kill you. People justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.

> *"He who dares not offend cannot be honest."  
-- Thomas Paine [1737]*

> *"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

> *"Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal."  
-- Albert Camus [1913]*

> *"Always be a first rate version of yourself and not a second rate version of someone else."  
-- Judy Garland [1922]*

> *"Inside every cynical person, there is a disappointed idealist."  
-- George Carlin [1937]*

> *"Escape competition through authenticity." (...)  
"What the world craves is authenticity." (...)   
"To be honest speak without identity."
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### On accountability

<!--
> *"Make two people proud: your 8-year-old self and your 80-year-old self."  -- David Perell*
> *"Whenever you think that some situation or some person is ruining your life, it’s actually you who are ruining your life. It’s such a simple idea. Feeling like a victim is a perfectly disastrous way to make go through life."  -- Charlie Munger [1924]*

- every damn thing is your own fault, if you are any good.
- chi sei? sono l’evoluzione di tutti i miei errori.
- Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life. Part of being a man is getting shit done. A real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
- I approve of me. I take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax. Change your actions, not yourself. Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change. 
-->

> *"We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change."  
-- Katharine Hepburn [1907]*

You are your word.

Take responsibility. Only then you will cultivate respect for yourself and earn respect from others. Your choices have determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *"Commitment is what transforms a promise into a reality."  
-- Abraham Lincoln [1809]*

> *"Be the person your dog thinks you are."  
-- J.W. Stephens [1834]*

> *"Commitment is an act, not a word."  
-- Jean-Paul Sartre [1905]*

> *"I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me."  
-- S.E. Hinton [1948]*

> *"Truth only means something when it’s hard to admit."  
-- Nicholas Sparks [1965]*

> *"Without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it’s a relationship, a business or a hobby."  
-- Neil Strauss [1969]*

### On trust and reputation

<!--
- A person who trusts no one now, once trusted someone too much.
-->

> *"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life.

> *"There is no greater fraud than the promise not kept."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Who does not trust enough will not be trusted."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"You will earn the respect of all if you begin earning the respect of yourself."

> *"Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

-- George MacDonald [1824]*

> *"Quality means doing it right when no one is looking."  
-- Henry Ford [1863]*

> *"Words are deeds."  
-- Ludwig Wittgenstein [1889]*

> *"With enough courage, you can do without a reputation."  
-- Margaret Mitchell [1900]*

> *"Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you." (...)  
"When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"If you worry about your reputation you don’t deserve to have one."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Your character starts out spotless. You can only stain it." (...)  
"The selfish reason to be ethical is that it attracts the other ethical people in the network." (...)  
"Integrity is when what you think and what you say and what you do are one." (...)  
"Returns are made on the way up. Reputations are made on the way down." (...)  
"Living a life of integrity pays off, but it takes a very long time." (...)  
"Before you can lie to another, you must firt lie to yourself." (...)  
"Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Fame is a lagging indicator of distinctiveness. Reputation is a lagging indicator of trustworthiness."  
-- rapahelz@x*

## On humility

<!--
- Humility With forward action: "I wasn’t the smartest in X but.."  
-->

> *"The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk."  
-- Cicero [-106]*

Modesty means being comfortable that others will discover your greatness.

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect, and you’ll never be. Success means nothing in life; it’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. On the other hand, your emotional health lives on for hundreds of generations in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

One way to humble yourself is to place yourself in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

> *"Do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself."  
-- Plutarch [0046]*

> *"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."  
-- Ernest Hemingway [1899]*

> *"Humility is mostly about being very honest about how much you owe to luck."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Virtue signaling is popular because it lets anyone, regardless of objective merit, go on an ego trip."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"The highest form of humility is being teachable."  
-- rapahelz@x*

> *"You learn more from other people if you pretend you know less than them."  
-- alexhormozi@x*

### On respect

<!--
- I roamed as a kid. Always respectful to people and places we were at. Now, kids are so badly mannered and have zero respect for people’s things- If I don’t respect him, I’ll disrespect him. Nothing in between..
- Normalize ghosting girls at the first sign of disrespect.
- Respect isn’t earned anymore. It’s auctioned to the highest bidder.
- They don’t respect you at the bottom, they ignore you in the middle, and they hate you at the top. You’ll never have everyone’s approval. So it’s best to just focus on what you’re doing.
- you can't force someone to respect you, but you can refuse to be disrespected.
-->

> *"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t."  
-- Bill Nye [1955]*

You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch but what you probably want is respect and admiration from your peers.

-- iamaaronwill@x*

### On gratitude

> *"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."  
-- Cicero [-106]*

You opened two gifts this morning: your eyes. Play the cards you are dealt. And sometimes you will be dealt bad cards.

Being grateful is looking up. Don’t forget that a group of people blazed the trail we’re enjoying, and another group continues to maintain it.

> *"The blind can’t see. The proud will not." (...)  
"The day a blind man sees, the first thing he throws away is the stick that has helped him all his life."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich." (...)  
"When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be. When I let go of what I have, I receive what I need."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"Comparison is the thief of joy."  
-- Theodore Roosevelt [1858]*

> *"How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard."  
-- A.A. Milne [1882]*

-- William Arthur Ward [1921]*

> *"A good life is not a life without problems. A good life is a life with good problems."  
-- Mark Manson [1984]*

### How to apologise?

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

> *"Never ruin an apology with an excuse."  
-- Benjamin Franklin [1706]*

> *"Apology under pressure is not an apology."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Most excuses are just explanations. They don’t excuse anything."  
-- Mark Manson [1984]*

> *"If you have a dream, don’t waste your energies explaining why."

### On agency

<!--
+ farawaylaughtr@x -- 80% of what people call agency is trying the «dumb» solution and iterating from that. you can just do dumb things
+ signulll@x -- i’m not lazy, i just don’t want to hit my brain’s token limit for the day.

- As a man, never stay at home all day. Go out, make friends, and create new connections. A man's job is to face the world, take risks, and embrace difficulties.
- Chesterfield told his son in a 1754 letter that laziness is suicide by proxy, because by killing time you’re killing yourself. Dark but true
-->

> *"The most difficult is the decision to act, the rest is just tenacity."  
-- Andrea Earhart [1897]*

Hints:

- Help with a precise thing («I can drop a lasagna at 4:00.») instead of «I’m here for you». Helpful people don’t ask «how can I help». They just help.
- «It’s on documentation. If it’s not add it.»
- Without commitment, you’ll never start. Without consistency, you’ll never finish.
- You don’t need 100 self-help books, all you need is action + self-discipline.
- Get your dopamine from action.

# 1.2 - On growth

## On comfort and risk

<!--
- You think you are playing safe, but you are actually accumulating anxiety. Take bolder risks, it’s mentally liberating.
- If you want to grow as a man... Never stay in the same place for too long.
-->

> *"If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

You can choose courage or comfort, but you can’t choose both.

Comfort is the enemy of achievement. The size of your life is directly proportional to how much discomfort you are willing to endure. Breaking rules can be frightening and you keep doing what you’re good at to avoid confronting the real problems in your life. You’ll never achieve what you want in life without taking risks. Prioritizing risk over safety is the path to progress. If you act average, you’ll remain average. To outperform, you must be both different and correct. 


Hints:

- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you’d expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, spend a week alone in nature. Being uncomfortable should be «play» for you. Find comfort in discomfort.
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.
- This isn’t just a success strategy; it’s a well-being strategy. The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.
- Risk looks different for everyone. Stability without stagnation.
- Which do you want - the pain of stayng where you are, or the pain of growth?
- When the love-of-life line crosses the fear-of-death line, all hell breaks loose.

> *"When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it."  
-- Vincent Van Gogh [1853]*

> *"A ship is safe in the harbor but that’s not what ships are for."

> *"Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible."

> *"If we’re growing, we’re always going to be out of our comfort zone."  
-- John C. Maxwell [1947]*

> *"Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On risk management

> *"Never test the depth of the river with both feet."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Being risk-prone is better than being risk-averse, but don’t allow yourself to be out of the game. Adventure comes from perceived risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can work up to scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.

> *"If your life is free of failures, you’re not taking enough risks."  
-- H. Jackson Brown Jr. [1940]*






---
## On improving

> *"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time.

The accumulation of experience and the analysis of past situations will structure knowledge. 

	PROGRESS = PAIN + REFLECTION

	SKILL = EFFORT * TALENT

Hints:

- Listen to someone explaining challenging techniques, and then attempt to follow their advice. Seek feedback as it accelerates learning.
- If it’s easy and you’re not surprised, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and face challenges. That’s when real learning occurs.
- Reflect on your mistakes; try to identify the cues you missed and what to look for next time.
- Repeat.

### Improving by analysis

> *"Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience."  
-- Otto von Bismarck [1815]*

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t necessarily bring something new. Innovation comes from having a broader perspective and analyzing past situations. People often repeat the same mistakes. You improve by examining your failures; it will help you let go.

Hints:

- Fastest way to learn is to teach. Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
- Journal early before your inhibitions take in. Record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want.

> *"You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward."  
-- Steve Jobs [1955]*

### On applied knowledge

<!--
- don’t be so busy preparing for teh future that you never step into it. the satisfaction of binge consumption brings instant gratification, so whty try anything else? the problem with shoving information is the ilusion of knowledge, especially when you rush it.true learning requires comtemplation. And implementation. And a commitment to reflecting on great ideas over and over again.

> *"Knowledge without action is useless. «Pathological learners» who are voracious consumers of knowledge live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it."  
-- Unknown*

Action, not knowledge, leads to success. If you are not consistently applying the new information you’re learning, then it’s merely educational porn.

- knowledge is knowing what to say. wisdom is knowing when to say it.
-->

> *"Wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one’s own advice."  
-- Sam Harris [1967]*

Wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions.

### On mastery

<!--
- There’s always room for improvement; be humble. There is no place for a «prima donna». If you’re not improving today, you’re regressing. Skills are perishable, and the path to mastery is a never-ending story. Some of the skills you need to achieve expertise have not yet been systematized.

-- Niels Bohr [1885]*

> *"First a punch is just a punch. Then a puch is not only a punch. And finally a punch is just a punch."  
-- Bruce Lee [1940]*

True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know.

Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult. It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were. It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you. I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears. So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up."

Hints:

- Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory and persuasion.
- Believe in principles. The basics are really important, not jargon or specifics. Understand it, not memorize it. You only need to understand a few basic concepts. complexity emerges from very simple rules.
- Applied focus. This means that while you should only strive for mastery in a small handful of skills, you should seek to be competent in a wide variety of disciplines. Don’t major on minor things.
- School fails in subjects like: how to build self confidence / how to be good with money / dating and relationships skills / confrontation skills / critical thinking / creative productivity.
- Education leads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward a final self-definition.
- School rewards generalists, the world not so.
- School’s real study topic is obedience. No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them.
- Success is the worst teacher.
- The biggest mistake anyone makes when studying a foreign language is that they do it little by little, not jumping into it head first. Language is not mathematics; one doen’t need to learn it, one needs to get accustomed to it. It’s not about logic or memory; It’s about experience and skill.

> *"The strongest intellectual foundation is built upon science, math and philosophy, as they are the search for universal truths." (...)

"Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory, and persuasion." (...)  
"Timeless: science, math, philosophy, rhetoric. First principles. Creating art & business. Family & lifelong friends. Habits to calm mind & body. Temporary: politics, news, estertainment. Memorizing facts. Hourly work. Transactional relationships. Drugs & doctors for mind and body." (...)  
"The ideal school would teach health, wealth and happiness. It would be self-paced and available to all. It would show opposing ideas and students would self-verify truth. No grades, no tests, no diplomas - just learning. Actually you’re already here. Careful who you follow."

> *"I don’t believe in book recommendations lol. Reading what everyone else is already reading—especially books has minimal value (hardly a novel observation) therefore you should allocate your time differently. If everyone’s reading it, the insights are already absorbed into the zeitgeist or regurgitated online. Reading what’s obscure gives you asymmetric knowledge—potentially valuable ideas others haven’t yet mined. There’s a counter: sometimes it pays to understand why a popular book resonates. It’s less about the book itself & more about mapping the cultural moment or the biases of the masses. For this use case I just use chatgpt."

### On email

Hints:

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.

## On habits and systems

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
-- Will Durant [1885]*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits. Habits are like compound interest in real life.

Consistency doesn’t result from effort, it comes from showing up. Long-term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life. Endurance is more relevant than toughness.

Hints:

- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others. Annual review: GOOD + BAD.
- You do not raise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Stop a bad behaviour by filling the space with a better one. Replacement is better than abstinence.

> *"People don’t decide their future, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures."  
-- F.M. Alexander [1869]*

> *"Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential."

> *"Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are to heavy to be broken."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"You'll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is found in your daily routine."  
-- John C. Maxwell [1947]*

> *"The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"At any given time, I’m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit." (...)  
"It isn’t 10k hours that creates outliers, it’s 10k iterations." (...)  
"I probably read 1-2 hours a day, and that puts me in the top 0,00001%."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to change habits?

> *"Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things."  
-- Charles Duhigg [1974]*

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.

Hints:

- Try to break a bad habit and form a good one every 6 months.
- Avoid low-leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and negative bias), pointless notifications, social media (use it for output, not entertainment; other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning or the last thing at night), owning a TV, overworking, unhealthy relationships, judgment, micromanagement, perfectionism, virtue signaling.
- Cultivate high-leverage habits: develop useful skills, exercise, rest, meditate, travel, read, journal, enjoy music, create, network, make friends, spend time outdoors with friends and family, indulge in massages, practice gratitude, forgive, prioritize self-awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, prioritize sleep and naps, smile, and embrace colors.
- Small steps are more likely to lead to success. For example, if you find resistance to meditating for 15 minutes, try starting with just five minutes.
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making an agreement with someone that includes financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to reinforce new habits.
- Pay attention, correct your course and don’t judge. Don’t strive for perfection. Having a few vices makes life more interesting.

# 1.3 - On envy triggers

## On talent

<!--
- You discover your true intelligence once you start acting instead of overthinking.
- IQ is like speed of running. If you run in a wrong direction, it will not help you.
-->

> *"The difference between sounding smart and being smart is «I don’t know»." (...)  
"The real test of intelligence is if you get what you want from life."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction."  
-- Ernst F. Schumacher [1911]*

To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays. Talent is fragile and it’s the most sensitive envy trigger.

Intelligence is a spectrum, your dog is intelligent also.

> *"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination." (...)  
"The measure of intelligence is the ability to change."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."  
-- Isaac Asimov [1920]*

> *"I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that’s not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile."  
-- Malcolm Gladwell [1963]*

> *"Intelligence is curiosity. It is that and only that. If you are curious, you are intelligent. If you are not curious, you are not intelligent. In fact, politically correct be damned, I will say it straight: A general lack of curiosity is a general lack of intelligence. I will even go so far as to say that a general lack of curiosity is the worst of all traits." (...)  
"Curiosity is a form of creation."  
-- Zan Perrion [1964]*

-- Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*

### On geniality

<!--
+ signulll@x -- the illusion of human exceptionalism crumbles fast when you see how much of our intelligence is just pattern recognition & predictive modeling. ai exposes how much of what we call «creativity» is remixing, how much «insight» is regurgitation, & how much «expertise» is just memorized heuristics.

## On wealth

<!--
+ alexhormozi@x -- Three levels of wealth: No meetings. Lots of meetings. No meetings.

- Money loves speed. Wealth loves time. Poverty loves indecision.
- Wealth is the slave of the wise man and master of the fool.
- «I made my millions by brewing my own coffee at home.» -- Said no one ever. If you want to achieve wealth: you need to create, not save.
- people don't get rich because of intelligence. Most people who get rich in business are usually insanely self-disciplined. Self-discipline is the real metric for succes
-->

> *"To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy." (...)  
"No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Being rich is being fulfilled. An unhurried sense of time is in itself a form of wealth.

> *"Contentment is natural wealth; luxury is artificial poverty."  
-- Socrates [-470]*

> *"Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth."  
-- Epicurus [-341]*

> *"Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

> *"All my possessions for a moment of time."

> *"We are not rich by what we possess but by we can do without."

### On money

<!--
- Never worship money, but always avoid people who hate money. They hate competence. They have a distorted view of reality. They are losers. Never associate with losers... or you’ll become one.
+ naval@x -- Don’t make things so you can make money; make money so you can make things.

Money is a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams. However, the perpetual pursuit of more is not the path to happiness. Money doesn’t purchase happiness; it buys freedom.

> *"Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"We don’t make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies."  
-- Walt Disney [1901]*

-- Aristotle Onassis [1906]*

> *"A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### How to get wealthy without luck

<!--
- I don’t waste time with unpriced listings.
-->

> *"You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money; you get rich by saving your time to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Making money is not about luck. 

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
- Equip yourself with specialized knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specialized knowledge is what you learn uniquely, not through standard education. If society can teach it to you, it can teach it to others, making you replaceable. You acquire specialized knowledge by following your genuine interests, not just current trends. While you might find it enjoyable, others may see it as hard work. This kind of knowledge is usually passed on through apprenticeships, not traditional schooling. It often involves technical or creative expertise that’s difficult to outsource or automate.
- Embrace responsability and take business risks under your own name. In exchange, society might grant you more duties, ownership, and influence. The most accountable people usually have unique, public, and bold personal brands, like Oprah, Trump, Kanye, and Elon.
- Select partners with intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Stay away from cynics and pessimists, as their negative beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
- To become wealthy, offer what society wants but can’t access easily, and do it at a large scale. Pick an industry for long-term projects with similar-minded people. The internet has opened up diverse career options, yet many haven’t realized this. Focus on persistent efforts. In life, the most substantial gains come from building on past progress. Money is a tool for trading experiences. Create valuable experiences to build your wealth.
- Prioritize building wealth instead of chasing money or status. Wealth involves owning assets that generate income without constant effort. Understand that it’s possible to create wealth ethically. Don’t pay attention to those who focus on status games; they often gain status by criticizing wealth builders. Money is a sensitive topic as many tie their self-worth and identity to their jobs and earnings, reflecting their skills and competence in the market. 
- You won’t achieve significant wealth by simply trading your time for money. To attain financial freedom, you must have ownership or equity in a business or venture. You’re spending time to save money when you should be spending money to save time.
- When you eventually attain wealth, you will realize that it wasn’t your primary pursuit in the first place. Free wealth: Books, friends, sleep, ideas, questions, gratefulness, laugh.
- Being broke is hard. Becoming rich is hard. Choose your hard.

> *"He who works all day has no time to make money." (...)  
"I would rather earn 1% off 100 people's efforts than 100% of my own efforts."  
-- John D. Rockefeller [1839]*

> *"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

> *"To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Rich people stay rich by living like they’re broke. Broke people stay broke by living like they’re rich."  
-- T. Harv Eker [1954]*

> *"I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or «incentives» for skill."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Money follows execution, not precedes it." (...)  
"Making money is not something that you do - it’s a skill that you learn." (...)   
"If you want to be wealthy, spend your time earning, learning, or relaxing. Outsource or ignore everything else." (...)  
"Management is the oldest, and most over-rated form of leverage. Capital, media, and code are the modern forms." (...)  
"Asymmetric opportunities: invest in startups. Start a company. Create a book, podcast, video. Create a (software) product. Go on many first dates. Go to a cocktail party. Read a Lindy book. Move to a big city. Buy bitcoin. Tweet." (...)  
"Much of investing is avoiding FOMO buying and panic selling." (...)  
"It doesn’t take money to make money, it takes leverage to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Four ways to make money: 1. Save people time 2. Save people money 3. Make people money 4. Make people happy" (...)  
"Where there’s value, there’s money."  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

### On money management

<!--
- Salary is for expenses. Equity is wealth. Invest in yourself and stop renting your time. Be an owner.
- It’s crazy to think the entire real estate market is propped up by what is essentially the entire middle class being 100x long.
- inflation = printing money.
- Stock buybacks are effectively same as dividends.
- entrepreneurship vs investment - 2 different mentalities.
- auctions ao contrario! vendo por 40mil. o q venderes dai para cima 50% é para ti!
- analise fundamental e técnica no poker como nas accoes. Crashes are typical of complex systems.
- why do you want to invest? to make excitement or to make money?
-->

> *"I succeeded because I have a long attention span. (...)  
"Waiting helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can’t stand to wait."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

The secret of healthy finances is not to make more money but to keep some.

Hints:

- Diversify with uncorrelated investment bets (barbell strategy).
- Spend less than you make. Saving 10% of all paychecks is a good start. Keep some liquidity, avoid investing in anything you can’t sell in a month or two.
- Modern slaves are not chains, they are debt. Ultimately is about the total cost of the mortgage. That is the price of the home. The closing price is an illusion. Today, people with moderate incomes, are forced to speculate or live in poverty.

> *"It is a wise man who lives with money in the bank, it is a fool who dies that way."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Gold is money. Everything else is credit."  
-- J.P. Morgan [1837]*

> *"Diversification may preserve wealth, but concentration builds wealth." (...)  
"Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1." (...)  
"It’s nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don’t want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it’s a little like saving sex for your old age."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"Are you placing enough interesting, freakish, long shot, weirdo bets?"  
-- Tom Peters [1942]*

> *"For every dollar you spend purchasing something substantial, expect to pay a dollar in repairs, maintenance, or disposal by the end of its life."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"When volatility or drawdowns are large, the price contains no information." (...)  
"400% up is equivalent to 80% down. And when you look at graphs use log scale. Linear is uninformative."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"The best investments are «buy and forget.»" (...)  
"The two biggest investing mistakes are panic buying and panic selling." (...)  
"The Memorial Day we remember our unrealized gains." (...)  
"Markets do find truth - first by moving up to the last FOMO buyer, then by moving down to the first HODLer." (...)  
"The larger the herd, the lower the returns." (...)  
"I only believe in micro. I don’t believe in macro." (...)  
"All returns in life, weather in wealth, relationships or knowledge come from compound interest." (...)  
"A great reason to buy instead of renting is that you get to fire your landlord."  
"Understanding economics means continually asking, «But at what cost?»" (...)  
"Every generation has to learn the lesson of inflation firsthand." (...)  
"Diversification is a hedge against a lack of knowledge." (...)  
"The best investors have no use for spreadsheets."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Money just comes to me because I know where to stand."  
-- ChelseaLazkani@x*

### On investment comfort zone

> *"When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Scared money never wins. It’s all about the risk of losing money versus the risk of missing opportunity. 

> *"The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket."  
-- Kin Hubbard [1868]*

> *"I’m not interested in anything that’s not sustainable. Friendships, investing, careers, podcasts, reading habits, exercise habits. If I can’t keep it going, I’m not interested in it."  
-- morganhousel@x*

### How to spot good investments?

> *"It’s not what you buy. It’s what you pay. There is no asset which is so good that it can’t be overpriced and very few assets which are so bad that they can’t be underpriced. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism."  
-- Howard Marks [1946]*

What’s my religion? Arbitrage and rents.

Hints:

- What’s going to stay the same in the next ten years. While boring, offer the best investment opportunities.
- Where is low optimism. Recessions are caused when a bunch of people lose confidence all at once.
- Know who are the buyers, the sellers and their motivations.
- Investments are competing with each other.
- The best companies aren’t sold, they’re bought. Stay away from junk stocks.
- The more you know, the less you need to diversify. Diversification is an hedge against lack of knowledge.
- Take risk from the table whenever possible.
- Don’t buy on future hopes, buy on past mistakes. We don’t loose money on star businesses, we loose money on businesses we think will be star businesses.
- Good investors don’t sell investment advice and not talk about their returns.

> *"Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the real rent of land."  
-- Adam Smith [1790]*

> *"You’re looking for a mispriced gamble." (...)  
"Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand. You must learn to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds." (...)  
"What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

> *"The future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious."  
-- John Sculley [1939]*

> *"If someone is trying to convince you it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Never take investment advice from someone who has to work for a living."   
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"The #1 thing you should look for in an investor is conviction."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"I don’t buy property because I think the value is going to go up. I buy property because I can make the value go up."  
-- realestatetrent@x*

> *"The stock market is the only market where things go on sale and all the customers run out of the store." 
-- cullenroche@x*

## On popularity

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."  
-- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.
Don’t strive to be well-known, strive to be worth knowing.

> *"He who is known as an early riser need not get up until noon." (...)  
"We’ll know that rock is dead when you have to get a degree to work in it."  
-- vox populi*

> *"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time. Sometimes it will be ahead, other times it will be behind. But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

> *"If you’re not ready to be hated, you’re not ready to be famous." (...)  
"The reward for getting on the stage is fame. The price of fame is that you can’t get off stage." (...)  
"You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous." (...)  
"Venture funds sell brand for the right to invest money." (...)  
"You don’t want fame, you want respect. Respect comes from living up to their standards. You don’t want respect, you want self-respect. Self-respect comes from living up to your own standards. The same standards that you apply to other people."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Influencers are just oversharers who got lucky."  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

## On beauty and style

<!--
- taste may be an instinct for honest signals
-->

> *"If cats looked like frogs we’d realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember."  
-- Terry Pratchett [1948]*

A beautiful person always see beauty in others. Beauty grabs attention. Personality grabs the heart.

> *"Many complain of their looks but none of their brains."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"The only thing more mysteriously attractive than beauty is corruption."  
-- Octave Mirbeau [1848]*

> *"A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman."  
-- Coco Chanel [1883]*

> *"Elegance is a physical quality. If a woman doesn’t have it naked, she’ll never have it clothed."  
-- Karl Lagerfeld [1933]*

-->

> *"The secret to living well and longer is: eat half, walk double, laugh triple and love without measure."  
-- vox populi*

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

### How to stay healthy?

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training is training flexibility (yoga or animal movements) and strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting.
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated.

- When you watch sports on TV, you are watching other men live out their dreams while you doing nothing for your own dreams. You are a Dream Cuck.
- You don’t have to be rich to start living the life you want. Most people were just brainwashed into thinking that they wanted a luxurious, expensive lifestyle. A happy life tends to be much simpler: a healthy body, a mind at peace, a loving family, time to do what you love.

-- David Hockney [1937]*

It’s okay to live a life others don’t understand. 

We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die. When life becomes about enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

Hints:

- Build a business with the heuristic of «maximize my vacation time». You will often be presented with two options: the lucrative option and the lifestyle option. 
- Aspire to work 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.
- Aspire to move past room-mates, commutes, alarm clocks and calendars. (Naval Ravikant)
- Own my house on a few acres with clean water river frontage, and assets I can enjoy & be creative with (car, bike, music equipment, tools, etc)  
- How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life? Geoarbitrage. Car: max 10K. Job: live next to it. Income doesn’t make you rich. spending habits do.
- The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression. Create a life you don’t need a vacation from. Making money in order to consume goods can’t mankinds’s sole purpose on this planet.
- 3 hobbies: one creative, one to keep in shape and one to make money.
- House + work + third place. We drink to loosen our tongues. Feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
- I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.
- You can never be over dressed or over educated but avoid clothing that are more interesting than you are.
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

### On travel

> *"Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain."  
-- Jack Kerouac [1922]*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with «lifers»: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

-- Albert Camus [1913]*

> *"A vacation + a disaster = an adventure."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

## On success

<!--
-->

> *"Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it."  
-- Marva Collins [1936]*

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period. Succeeding means securing advantage.

	SUCCESS = EDUCATION + ACTION

Success (and happiness) is internal not external. True fulfillment comes from living not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material. When people finally became a «success» they realize that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100K in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them.

Hints:

- The true measure of success is a calm nervous system.
- Success is a collection of well curated failures.
- The most successful people are those who are good at plan b.

> *"Success lies in relentless execution of the basics."  
-- Leonardo Da Vinci [1452]*

> *"The way to succeed is to double your failure rate."  
-- Thomas John Watson Sr. [1874]*

> *"Strive not to be a success, but rather be of value."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man."  
-- Louis L’amour [1908]*

> *"Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming."

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Want to get ahead in life? Start genuinely rooting for others to succeed. It’s as simple as that."  
-- Sahil Bloom [1991]*

> *"Your current results are just the visible output of your old decisions compounding over time. But since people evaluate based on short-term signals, they often misinterpret whether something is actually working. This is why so many businesses & individuals chase surface level metrics instead of real durable progress. Early effort often leads to decline before real takeoff, but most people quit before the inflection point."

### On barriers to success

Fear, not failure, is the biggest barrier to success. Some people are terrified of success, they may be forced to buy a suit.

We don’t get successful by knowing everything, we get successful by listening.

- cages aren’t made of iron, they’re made of thoughts.
- It took me 13 years to realize that the only cure to depression is just leaving the house at every single possible opportunity no matter how badly you don’t want to.
- Most people are not extremes and most people are in the middle. Most things are not binary. Introvert is not shyness. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7. It’s hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.

> *"If you are depressed you are living in the past.  
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

- Depression (under-stimulation) can be viewed as a lack of self-expression. It may arise when one feels powerless or dominated, leading to chronic stress as a way to stimulate oneself.
- Anxiety (over-stimulation) manifests as hypersensitivity and can be linked to our evolutionary need for control. Anxiety isn’t productive planning; it’s a continuous state of apprehension over various scenarios. Worrying about the unknown is unproductive; we have limited control and primarily influence rather than dictate outcomes. Stress often results from excessive concern, and worrying is a misuse of the imagination. The past exists only in your thoughts; what truly matters is the present and the future.

Hints:

- The two best doctors: Mr. Outdoors (sunshine, water, air, exercise) and Mrs. Diet.
- Stress is who you think you should be. Peace is who you are. As I began to love myself, my relationship with everyone changed.
- Financial health is just as important as physical health. Nothing feels as good as having a «fuck you» fund.
- Therapy (awareness of past) / Spirituality (awareness of present) / Yoga (awareness of future)
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
- Anxious persons feel the only way to achieve relaxed certainty is getting new info but the more you know the more you’ll realize you don’t know.
- Avoiding anxiety leads to more anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
- Thinking about it makes it worse. Writing about it makes it better.
- Burnout is an oversaturation of the sameness.
- No purpose attracts depression. Unemployment makes you unhappy. Dot.
- Seeds of doubt grow into forests of inaction.
- The hardest prison to escape is in your own mind. Depression hates a moving target.

> *"If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play."  
-- Jason Nemer [1978]*

Action cures everything. Physical stress eliminates the need for control.

Hustling (the right amount of stimulation) involves consistently stretching your comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.

Hints:

- The best antidepressant is knowing that we matter to others. People don’t die from suicide; they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to reduce the need for control. When you’re feeling stressed out, take a moment to breathe. Remember that body language affects your psychology, mood, and even hormonal balance. People tend to be naturally happier when they’re kept busy. Exercise is a celebration of what your body can do not a punishment for what you ate.
- Diet is also relevant: *debug* your body as much as you can.

-->

> *"We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light."  
-- Plato [-427]*

Fear is paralyzing. Fear does not stop death, it stops life. 

When you view everything through the lens of fear, you’re more likely to remain in retreat mode. Anger and excuses often mask underlying fears. Remember that all excuses can be challenged. The best years of your life are the ones in which you take ownership of your problems rather than blaming them on your family, the environment, or the president. Living in reality requires less energy than cultivating a victim mentality. Escaping reality drains your energy. What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown. fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.

## On failure

> *"Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Fail fast and bounce back quickly.

A failure is a man who has blundered but is not capable of cashing in on the experience. Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax. We should fear missing opportunity more than we should fear failure.

Smart people aren’t used to failing, so they struggle to learn from their mistakes and often respond by blaming someone else.

### On anger

> *"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you."  
-- Bob Harris (fictional)*

Anger is a punishment we give ourselves for someone else’s mistake.

Hint: 

- Pay attention to what people say out of anger, they’ve been dying to tell you that.
- Most angry people are envious people who don’t understand that life will only get better once they are focused on their own lives and actively improving who they are.

> *"An angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes."  
-- Cato the Younger [-095]*

> *"And God said «love your enemy», and I loved myself."  
-- Kahlil Gibran [1883]*

### On scars and wounds

<!--
- i don’t hide my scars. they are proof that i showed up for life. and fought.
- if you don’t heal what hurt you, you’ll bleed on people who didn’t cut you.
-->

> *"A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole."  
-- China Mieville [1972]*

Don’t punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.

## On shame, confidence and validation

<!--
- Do what scares you until it doesn’t.
- How you view yourself is how people will view you.
- humble enough to know i’m replaceable. cocky enough to know is a downgrade.
- Normalize this. Normalize that. How about you feel shame for once?
- People with low self-esteem protect themselves by not taking risks. High self-esteem gives you the power of confidence to take chances.
- you cannot live when you are untouchable. Life is vulnerability.
-->

> *"Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."  
-- Andre Malraux [1901]*

> *"Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."  
-- Brené Brown [1965]*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide. The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings compensate insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure. 

> *"I was ashamed of myself when I realized that life was a costume party; and I attended with my real face."

> *"Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure."  
-- Alan Watts [1915]*

### On confidence and validation

<!--
- Confidence in public comes from discipline in private.
- I can see in his eyes whether he’s confident about himself.
- I can tell if his confidence is fake. Real confidence is like an aura, calm assuredness. Fake confidence is loud, annoying and needy.
- If her words can hurt you Then you are WEAK
- People who lack self-confidence love to make fun of others and denigrate their success, that’s how they feel better about themselves, don’t take it personally.
- The more confident a man is, the slower he will talk
- you’re so busy doubting yourself while so many others are intimidated by your potential.
-->

> *"One who believes in himself has no need to convince others." (...)  
"When you accept yourself, the whole world accepts you."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes."  
-- Leo Buscaglia [1924]*

> *"Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction."  
-- Bobbe Sommer [1936]*

Confidence is the opposite of shame. Confidence is shamelessness. 

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker.

Hints:

- Too many people undervalue what they are and overvalue what they are not. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. 
- To get self-aceptance you have to do the unconfortable things that you know you are right. When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets. It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- Confidence markers: the space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel. Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked. The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you don’t believe you are good, you’ll never be good. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech.
- Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.
- get confidence: impress yourself
- Not being insecure about an unattractive quality instantly makes you way more attractive. Generally the thing you’re most ashamed of is actually your biggest strenght/asset but you haven’t figured out how to use it.
- Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.
- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
- Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness.
- Confidence come from some success. You need some accomplishment to get there.
- Everything you’re running away is in your head. We hold on to something so tight because we fear something so great won’t happen twice.
- Money problems are self-confidence problems.
- Confident people don’t crave attention.

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to overcome shame and grow confidence?

> *"Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."  
-- Tyrion {fiction}*

Honesty is the pathway to confidence.

When hiding something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it.

> *"Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them."  
-- Augusten Burroughs [1965]*

> *"Just get out of the room."  
-- Robert Glover [1955]*

> *"Confidence is derived from options."  
-- Rollo Tomassi [1969]*

> *"The less confident you are, the more serious you have to act."  
-- Tara Ploughman {fiction}*

> *"Cringe is to mental growth what muscle soreness is to physical growth."  
-- cpaik@x*

### On entitlement and ego

<!--
- People will tolerate a bit of arrogance if you are talented and still young; but once you get older, you understand that you could have attracted many more opportunities if you had had the intelligence to learn humility earlier in life.
-->

> *"Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity."  
-- Amy Cuddy [1972]*

> *"Rudeness is the weak person’s imitation of strength."  
-- Eric Hoffer [1902]*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, being jealous and insecure does.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody so I deserve special treatment.
- I’m worse than everybody so I deserve special treatment.

### On addictions

<!--
- Porn isn’t real sex. Cocaine isn’t real energy. Alcohol isn’t real courage. Gambling isn’t real investing. Nightly news isn’t real facts. Social media isn’t really social. Business books aren’t real business.
- signs of a man who has lost control of his life: watch porn. addicted to comfort. addicted to drugs and alcohol. spend all day indoor.
- So many men lose themselves trying to make an ungrateful woman happy.
-->

> *"The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly sallary."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

Nietzsche describes 3 modern vices: OVERWORK (to be constantly busy is self-negation. It betrays a «will to forget» oneself), CURIOSITY (vague curiosity about everything, without deep obsessions, goes nowhere), SYMPATHY (sympathy for all means a refusal to rank good and bad).

> *"Addiction to knowledge is like any other addiction. It offers an escape from the fear of emptiness, of loneliness, of frustration, the fear of being nothing."  
-- k__quotes@x*

### On introversion

<!--
+ karunpal@x -- Introverts, being "too nice" is not kindness, it’s a trauma response. Where does this come from? For many, it starts in childhood: Growing up in unpredictable environments; having to please parents to avoid punishment or neglect; believing your worth depends on keeping others happy. This behavior becomes survival.
+ kaseyklimes@x -- the introvert/extrovert dichotomy has always struck me as a bit silly. people generally gain energy spending time with people they feel they can be their authentic selves around. they generally spend energy being around people they feel they can’t.
-->

> *"You think you are an introvert because you like being alone. But in reality you just love being in peace. And you’re actually extroverted around people who bring you peace."  
-- zacharylaid@x*

There are no introverts, only people that don't feel safe.

> *"Intellectualism is a common cover-up for fear of direct experience."

## On jealousy and envy

<!--
- A inveja mata-nos. O sucesso dá-nos vida!
- Humans hate the most successful humans as it makes their little egos feel inferior.
-->

> *"You’ll never be criticized by someone who is doing more than you. You’ll always be critized by someone who is doing less. Remember that."  
-- Denzel Washington [1954]*

> *"Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people."  
-- Henry Thomas Buckle [1821]*

Envy is a sign that you are not focused on your life.

Jealousy is the face of low self-esteem. An healthy mind does not speak ill of others.

Outliers inspire envy. Once they stop talking to you, they start talking about you. Intelligence, wealth, fame, luck, beauty, health, sucess and lifestyle (freedom) are the main triggers.

Treat haters like toddlers. When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours. Only take advice from those achieving what you want to achieve. Ignore and be flattered by the rest. Never hate people who are jealous of you. Respect their jealousy - they think that you’re better than them. If someone is copying you, you won. Jealousy comes in jokes, pay attention.

-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

> *"They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself."  
-- tevsmith@x*

However beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy. When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.

> *"There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing."  
-- Aristotle [-384]*

> *"Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

### On empathy

> *"Empathy without boundaries is self destruction."  
-- khoucasian@x*

Honesty witout empathy is brutality. Empathy without honesty is manipulation.

> *"That which we are capable of feeling, we are capable of saying."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes [1547]*

## On pessimism

> *"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."  
-- William Arthur Ward [1921]*

> *"There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, «Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything», and an optimist who says, «Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way». Either way, nothing happens."  
-- Yvon Chouinard*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

Pessimism is seductive. Optimism sounds like a sales pitch, pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
While optimism is not always the way, pessimism is rarely the way. On the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

Hints:

- Entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic because they are rewarded by being optimistic. Intelectuals the opposite.
- You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic.
- Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than oportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.

> *"Both optimists and pessimists contribute to society. The optimist invents the aeroplane, the pessimist the parachute."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"Keep you thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your thoughts positive because your words become your behaviour. Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits becomes your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny."

> *"I’m always looking for a way to make it happen, not excuses why it won’t work."  
-- Aaron Walker [1910]*

-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Complaints don’t deliver complaints, they mostly reveal your weakness."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. The honest way to critique is to create the alternative." (...)  
"To see if they really think that things are getting worse, ask them if they’d rather live in the future or in the past." (...)  
"It’s good to be optimistic in the general and skeptical in the specific. It’s very dangerous to be pessimistic in the general and optimistic in the specific."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path."  
-- Mark Manson [1984]*

> *"That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be."

### On worry

> *"Worry gives small things a big shadow."  
-- vox populi*

Worrying is worshipping the problem. If you panic, panic early.

> *"If something is wrong fix it. But train yourself not to worry, worry fixes nothing."  
-- Ernest Hemingway [1899]*






---
## On perfectionism

> *"Perfectionism is the fear of being criticized."  
-- Caroline Myss [1952]*

> *"The perfect is the enemy of the good."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you derive success. From perfection you derive procastination, anxiety and depression. It’s liberating to see yourself as a «doist».

> *"The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men."  
-- George Eliot [1819]*

> *"We are all broken, that’s how the light gets in."

-- Ted Turner [1938]*

> *"Perfectionism doesn’t make you feel perfect; it makes you feel inadequate."

## On limits

<!--
- we are wired to blame: we blame ourselves or teh others. we are obsessed with fault.
- the fears we don’t face become our limits.
-->

> *"We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training."  
-- Archilochus [-680]*

Your fears define your limits.

Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development. 

> *"The person who says it cannot be done should not interrupt the person doing it."  
-- vox populi*

> *"A likely impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincing possibility."  
-- Aristotle [-384]*

> *"It’s not because things are difficult that we dare not venture. It’s because we dare not venture that they are difficult."

> *"Expectations are resentments waiting to happen."

### On motivation

> *"With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how»."  
-- Tony Robbins [1960]*

Everyone is motivated until the 4AM alarm, then it’s discipline.

Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Most people keep telling themselves old stories that aren’t serving them. Lazyness is resting before getting tired.

### On self awareness

> *"No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld [1613]*

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind. It reduces the gap between who you are and who you think you are. 

Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? So why would you be different?  

Hints:

- Meditation makes you more mindful. Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less reactive and enable you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings.
- Ask questions to challenge your assumptions: «What if I’m wrong about this?»

## On growing old

<!--
- As you get older, you want to simplify your life: family and friends with no drama, nutritional and exercising habits with no health risk, a neighborhood with no worry about public safety and cleanliness, time online with no anger and outrage. A simple, but better life.
- At twenty, you think you have the whole world figured out, then with every passing year, you become more humble, you stop jumping to conclusions, you stop judging people you actually don’t know.
- Spiritual maturity begins when we feel like we have to stop taking care of the world.
