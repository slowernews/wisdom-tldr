# 1.1 - On foundations

## On independence

<!--
- Codependent no more: How to stop controlling others and start caring for yourself.
- Practice doing without things you think you need.
- Once we’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.

3. You have to make the definite decision to succeed. The only thing separating you from your wildest dreams and ambitions is that you have not yet made the definite decision to achieve them.

> *'How we spend our days is how we spend our lives.' -- Annie Dillard*	
> *'Só os mais corajosos conseguem fazer a paz' -- Trump*
- There are many yous: Like apps on a smartphone, different systems in your brain with different goals can take control at different times, which is why you can behave so inconsistently. Meditation can prevent hijacking: Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less impulsively reactive and allow you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings. Mini-meditations help in the moment: By focusing on your breath during a tense moment you can get some of the long term effects of meditation right when you need them.

- I believe in principles. the basics are really important. not jargon or specifics. understand it not memorize it. you only need to understand a few basic concepts. complexity emerges from very simple rules.

> *'A man is free at the instant he wants to be.' -- Voltaire*

<!--
Your independence is your legacy. //não sei se legacy é a tradução certa!
-->
  
Take care of yourself first and the money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Telling *your* truth is not being selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you are able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

> *'I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'I can’t give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second.'*

> *'Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

## On authenticity

<!--
- core values: honesty everywhere. i dont want to be in place where i cant be honest. i want to make relationships with a long term prospect. flat hierarchy. i dont want to be around hierarchical systems. i want to treat everybody as a peer. angry. i dont want to be around angry people
- Personal branding will kill you. Personal DOING will save everyone around you. people justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.
- Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change. truth-a-better-way-to-talk-about-ourselves.
- CHANGE YOUR ACTIONS, NOT YOURSELF
- 5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction (integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)
- Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life. Part of being a man is getting shit done. A real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
- Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
- You must play by your rules, funnel your weird stuff to give you some advantage.
- im bad in following a script.
- i approve of me. i am my word. i keep my word / i take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.

> *'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'I'd rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not.' -- Kurt Cobain'*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don't need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.

If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate with you. Just be real and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to be great at everything. Find your context. You don’t need to suceed in every context.

## On accountability

<!--
- dishonesty is a reaction to fear.
- bravery is learned -> micro-bravery, start small
- Humility With forward action: 'I wasn’t the smartest in X but..'
- integrity is what you think is what you say, and the same what you do.
- Be willing to side with the minority.

> *'It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Be the person your dog thinks you are.' -- J.W. Stephens*

Take ownership of your life, only then you will cultivate respect for yourself and respect from others. Your choices determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *'We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change.' -- Katharine Hepburn*

> *'When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### How to grow your reputation?

Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life. Be impeccable with your word.

## On respect

> *'There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect neither you'll ever be. 

Success means nothing in life. It’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. Your emotional health, by the other hand, lives for hundreds of generations after in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

> *'Promptness is a sign of respect.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t.' -- Bill Nye*

> *'No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.' -- Paulo Coelho*

A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

### How to apologise

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

> *'It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On gratitude

<!--
> *'Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.' -- Lao Tzu*
Play the cards you are dealt. And you will often be dealt bad cards. Being grateful is looking down.
- A good life is not a life without problems. A good life is a life with good problems. mm

# 1.2 - On growth

## On comfort and risk

<!--
- This is where margins of safety come in. We build them to reduce the precariousness of chance. Large margins of safety are not always possible. Sometimes they are too expensive. Sometimes they are not available. The fukushima plant could have been designed with a margin of safety to better withstand a tsunami. It wasn’t. Why? Because redundancy is expensive. That’s the trade-off. You are safer, but it costs more money. Sometimes when the stakes are low, we decide the trade-off isn’t worth it. What decisions would you make differently if you were factoring safety margins into your life? To be fair, you can’t put them everywhere. Otherwise, your life might be all margin and no living. To figure out where else you should build margins of safety into your life, think of the times you’ve been terrified and desperate. Those might be good places to start learning from experience and making the most of your second chances.
- It is very popular to be over positive or over negative about it in the media (those people are usually wrong). So keep that in mind when reading those kind of opinions.
- make meetings over playing something. Charlie replaced “let’s grab coffee” with hikes and catch meetings in the park.
- This isn’t a success strategy. This is a WELL-BEING strategy.
- Stability without Stagnation
- FIVE PSYCHOLOGICAL ROADBLOCKS TO EXPLORING OUTSIDE OUR COMFORT ZONES: Authenticity, Likeability, Competence, resentment, morality
- 'And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.' -- machiavelli, chapter 6 of _The Prince_
- risk over safety is the way to pull forward. Risk Leads to Growth and Excitement. You will live a life that is filled with more excitement and fulfillment the more you take intentional risks.
Let your fears guide you. The Things That Scare You the Most Are the Things You Most Need to Do. mitigate risks. some people just have larger comfort zones.
-->

> *'If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal.' -- Paulo Coelho*

Without breaking rules, you'll not achieve anything great.

Breaking rules frightens people but comfort is the enemy of achievement. You keep doing what you’re good at to avoid facing the real problems in your life. The size of our life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable we are willing to be.

> *'I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.' -- John Cage*

> *'When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *'If I’d followed all the rules I’d never have gotten anywhere.' -- Marylin Monroe*

> *'Do one thing that scares you everyday.' -- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *'When the love-of-life line crosses the fear-of-death line, all hell breaks loose.' -- Johannes Rand*

> *'Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it.' -- Van Gogh*

> *'There is pleasure in the pathless woods.' -- Lord Byron*

> *'A ship is safe in the harbor but that’s not what ships are for.'*

> *'But how can you live and have no story to tell?' -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

You can choose courage or you can choose comfort, but you can’t choose both.  
Take risk. Big audacious risk. You’ll never get what you want in life without it.

[If you act average, you’re going to be average](chapter_2_groups.md#on-following-the-herd). To outperform, you must be different and correct.

Hints:

- The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you'd expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.
- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week. Being uncomfortable should be “play” for you. Get confort in disconfort.
- Risk prone is better than risk averse but dont allow to be out of the game. Adventure comes from percieved risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can build up to the scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.
- Risk looks different for everyone.

## On improving

<!--
1. You need to recognize when you’re not learning, for one thing. If it’s easy, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and have a hard time. Now you’re learning.
2. Find a mentor. Lacking that, find e.g. talk of someone explaining some hard techniques and then try to follow the advice. Even and especially if it feels clumsy at first.
3. Switch to a new job where you'll be exposed to new things. try to find a job where people do code review, feedback is how we learn faster.
5. Reflect on your mistakes, try to find what cues you missed and what you should look for next time. I've been doing this on weekly basis and I've learned a huge amount from figuring out underlying cause of what I did wrong.

- If you are not constantly expanding your mind, skill sets, and patterns of thought, then you are contracting them.

> *'The greatest teacher is called “doing”.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator.

- success is the worst teacher
- growth: get unconfortable. So adventure is more than just grist for future storytelling — it’s a way to learn optimally. And like anything that promotes self-improvement, it’s not always a comfortable process. “We need to be willing to grow,” says Jon. “We need to be willing to be uncomfortable.”
- Reading and experience train your model of the world. And even if you forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model of the world persists. Your mind is like a compiled program you've lost the source of. It works, but you don’t know why.

> *'The difference between theory and practice: in theory, there’s no difference between theory and practice; in practice, there is.' -- Van de Snepscheut*

### Improving by analysis

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t make new.

However action not knowledge leads to [success](chapter_appendix.md#on-success). Only applied knowledge is power.  
If you are not constantly taking action on the new information that you are learning then it’s just educational porn.

<!--
- career day an year -> journaling self analysis.
- skill fluency!
- ask yourself these three questions to truly uncover the root cause of the issues in your life:
1) What Are You Holding On To?What happened in your life that you are still angry, depressed, or frustrated with? What are you really holding onto that is holding you back.
2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle.
3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?
- Tony Robbins says that the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions that you ask yourself.
- Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
- If you’re not getting better today, you’re getting worse.
- Classes move as slowly as the slowest student. teachers should give you tricks.
- Conversation can be learned but not taught. Classes are easily used to infinitely postpone making the thousands of mistakes necessary to achieve fluency.
- Don’t waste time on more than learning more than a handful of conjugations for primarily first-person singular (I) and second-person singular (you) in the past, present, and future tenses, along with common phrases that illustrate them. Throw in a few auxilaries (to want to V, to need to V, to like to V, etc.)
- Make it your goal to screw up as often as possible in uncontrolled environments. Explicitly ask friends to correct you and reward them with thanks and praise when they catch you spouting nonsense, particularly the small understandable mistakes. 
- !!! Before you invest (or waste) hundreds and thousands of hours on a language, you should deconstruct it. !!! learn language: films, manga, phrasebook, dictionary, flashcards. Consider a new language like a new sport. analogy. advantages and train
- learn conjugations for “helping” verbs like “to want,” “to need,” “to have to,” “should,” etc. In Spanish and many others, this allows you to express yourself with “I need/want/must/should” + the infinite of any verb. Learning the variations of a half dozen verbs gives you access to all verbs. This doesn’t help when someone else is speaking, but it does help get the training wheels off self-expression as quickly as possible.

## On achieving mastery

<!--
- True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know. If they find themselves outside their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know.”
- Without a demonstrably immense superiority in skill over the novice, there can be no true experts, only laypeople with imposing credentials.

> *'The chess grand master considers no more moves than does the expert; he just knows which ones to look at.' -- Robyn Dawes*
The better players did not examine more possibilities, only better ones — just as Capablanca had claimed. The expert relies not so much on an intrinsically stronger power of analysis as on a store of structured knowledge. Ericsson argues that what matters is not experience per se but “effortful study,” which entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond one’s competence. (out of confort zone)!!
-->

> *'An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field' -- Niels Bohr*

After learning the rules, break them. Only then you can achieve mastery.  

> *'Pros are just amateurs who know how to gracefully recover from their mistakes.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Masters are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over.'-- Robert Greene*

> *'We have knowledge of a thing only when we have grasped its cause.' -- Aristotle*

> *'A real Dj has to know how to clear the floor. To know the worse it can happen and how to come back.' -- James Altucher*

> *'Amateurs play for tricks, masters play for position.'*

And don’t stop, skills are perishable and the path to mastery a never ending story. Some of the skills that you need to achieve expertise were not yet systemised.

> *'We don’t rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our training.' -- Archilochus*

> *'I am not young enough to know everything.' -- Oscar Wilde*

However mastery is an important trigger of arrogance. There is no place for a «prima donna» and there’s always room for improvement: be humble.

## On habits and systems

<!--
- Personality is malleable, in fact it’s so malleable we often don’t realize we’re forging a new one.
- Effort and reward have a linear relationship when the action is mindless and simple. Effort and reward have a diminishing returns relationship when the action is complex and multivariate. But when the action becomes purely psychological—an experience that exists solely within our own consciousness—the relationship between effort and reward becomes inverted. desiring a positive experience is itself a negative experience; accepting a negative experience is a positive experience.
- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others.

> *'At any given time, I'm either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit.*' -- Naval Ravikant*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits.

Consistency doesn’t come from effort, it comes from showing up. Long term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life.

### How to fix bad habits?

> *'Pain plus reflection equals progress.' -- Ray Dalio*

Pay attention, correct and don’t judge. Two vices is too much, none makes you boring.

Hints:

- Avoid low leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and are negatively biased), pointless notifications, social media (use it as an output not as entertainment. Other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning nor the last thing you see at night), own a TV, work long hours, bad relationships, judge, control of petty stuff, perfectionism, signaling virtue. 
- Cultivate high leverage habits: meditation, time outside with friends & family, exercise, rest, travel, useful skills, read, journal, music, create, network and make friends, massage, gratefulness, forgive, self awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, sleep/nap, smile, use colors. 

### How to create new habits?

> *'Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things.' -- Charles Duhigg*

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.

Hints:

- Small steps beat big dreams: the smaller the change the more likely you’ll actually make it. “Could I meditate for 15 minutes? No, I feel resistance, I’m not gonna do it. Okay, five? Huh, I don’t feel resistance to that. I feel like I can do it for five.”
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making a pact with someone to introduce financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to solidify new habits.

## On self awareness

<!--
- self wareness: look at mirror what went well today, what went badtoday, how can i get better. what instead of why. why questions make us focus on the problem, getting emotional and stuck in the past. what not why! what can i do for change. what makes us focusing in the solution. So take the time now to truly understand what your beliefs and patterns are in every area of life. The better we understand that future self the easier it is to make good decisions today in order to make life better for our future selves.
- we need to accept that people can do great things while still having flaws. Our heroes don’tr have to be perfect, and we can learn just as much from their imperfections as from their achievements.
- When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create.
-->

> *'No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong.' -- François de La Rochefoucauld*

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind. It reduces the gap between who we are and who we think we are.   

Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? So why would you be different?  

> *'The best mirror is an old friend.' -- George Herbert*

> *'Weeds are flowers too, once you get to know them.' -- A.A. Milne*

> *'The things we see every day are the things we never see at all.' -- G.K. Chesterton*

### How to grow self awareness?

> *'People who can't laugh at themselves will always be outwitted by people who can.' -- T. K. Coleman*

Hints:

- Ask questions. Closed-minded people focus more on being understood than on understanding others. They don’t want their ideas challenged and are typically frustrated that they can’t get the other person to agree with them. Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement and understand that there is always the possibility that they might be biased and that it’s worth the little bit of time it takes to listen the other person’s views.  
- Question your assumptions: “What if I’m wrong about this?”.
- Meditation makes you more mindful.

> *'Your brain has expectations, and it doesn’t want to be wrong. So when it’s wrong, it just makes up the difference' -- Erik Vance*

Our bodies were built to hunt and gather and move, not to stay still. However, the origin of most health problems is not physical but mental.

### On depression and anxiety

<!--
- Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction. -- m manson
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
- Avoiding Anxiety Leads to More Anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
Social Anxiety is never the problem, but trying to avoid social anxiety is. Social Anxiety Buster #1: Fake It ‘Til You Make It. Social Anxiety Buster #2: Be Present and Listen. Social Anxiety Buster #3: Mind Your Body Language

-->

> *'If you are depressed you are living in the past.   
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present.' -- Lao Tzu*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

-  Depression (under-stimulation) is the lack of self-expression. If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed to estimulate yourself. 
-  Anxiety (over-stimulation) creates hypersensitivity. Linked with our evolutionarily need of [control](chapter_3_action.md#on-control). Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Nothing is gained by worrying about «not knowing». We don’t control anything, at most we influence some stuff. Stress is caused by giving a fuck. If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. Worry is a misuse of the imagination. Past is only in your head. What’s important is present and future.
- Hustling (right amount of stimulation) is to be always stretching comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.  

> *'Boredom is a soul sucker. The unfed mind devours itself.' -- Gore Vidal*

> *'When people don’t express themselves, they die one piece at a time.' -- Laurie Halse Anderson*

> *'Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.' -- Søren Kierkegaard*  

### How to overcome them?

> *'If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play.' -- Jason Nemer*

Action cures everything. Physical stress avoids need for control. Hints:

- Best antidepressant is knowing we matter to others. People do not die from suicide, they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to diminish the need of control. If you are feeling stressed out.. breathe. Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance.
- Diet is also relevant: debug your body as much as you can.

## On fear, anger and excuses

<!--
- fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.
- What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown.
-->

> *'We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.' -- Plato*

Fear is paralyzing.

If you view everything through the lens of fear, you'll tend to stay in retreat mode. Anger and excuses are fear clothed. All excuses are refutable. The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own - do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. Living reality requires less energy than victim constiousness. Escaping reality sucks your energy.

> *'Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.' -- Paulo Coelho*

### How to overcome fear?

> *'We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them.' -- Christian Nestell Bovee*

Replace fear with curiosity. Hints:

- The antidote to fear is aceptance not courage.
- Conquering Fear = Defining Fear: define your fears not your goals. Break down your fears until you figure out the truth.
- “Whenever I feel anxious in general or about something specific, I take a piece of paper and lay it out in landscape and create three columns. In the first column on the far left, I write at the top, “What are all the worst things that could happen, however absurd?” In the middle column I write, “What could I do to mitigate the horrible things from happening?” and in the far right column I write, “What could I do to get back to where I am now, if these things happen?” Tim Ferriss calls this exercise “Fear-Setting”.

> *'It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.' -- Sir Edmund Hillary*

### On courage

> *'Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.' -- Ayaan Hirsi Ali*

> *'Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.' -- Anaïs Nin*

> *'Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.' -- Maya Angelou*

Heros and cowards feel the same fear but their answers are different. Courage implies low reverence.

> *'Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing.' -- Edmund Burke*

> *'All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle.' -- Francis of Assisi*

> *'Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.' -- Lao Tzu*

## On mistakes, failure and regrets

<!--
- (kk) To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
- (kk) When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.
> *'If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

> *'Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment'. -- Jim Horning*

> *'We're even wrong about which mistakes we're making.' -- Carl Winfeld*

Fail fast and bounce back quickly: sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.

Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax. 

> *'The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one.' -- Elbert Hubbard*

> *'Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavor.' -- Truman Capote*

> *'Prove all things; hold fast that which is good.' -- 1 Thessalonians 5:21*

> *'Calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail.' -- A.J. Jacobs*

> *'It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it.' -- Lou Holtz*

> *'It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

### On regrets

> *'Sorrow is better than fear. Fear is a journey, a terrible journey. But, sorrow is at least an arriving.' -- Alan Paton*

> *'A life spent making mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful, than a life spent doing nothing.' -- George Bernard Shaw*

Be gentle first with yourself. Don't punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you. Don’t ever regret anything because regretting means wanting to forget every moment. Every moment is what makes you who you are today.

> *'It’s not just other people we need to forgive. Sometimes we need to forgive ourselves.' -- Mitch Albom*

> *'You’re going to make mistakes in life. It’s what you do after the mistakes that counts.' -- Brandi Chastain*

> *'Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift.' -- Mary Oliver*

Suffering is a temporary but essential part of life.

Making mistakes is better than faking perfections. Every difficulty carries with it a corresponding opportunity of equal size.

> *'Your pain, is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding.' -- Kahil Gibran*

> *'Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.' -- Kahlil Gibran*

> *'A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole.' -- China Mieville*

## On shame, confidence and validation

<!--
> *'Just get out of the room.' -- Robert Glover*
-->

> *'Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change.' -- Brene Brown*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide.

The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings, are disguises, masks, to compensate for inadequacies, physical & mental insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure.

### On validation

<!--
- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
-->

> *'Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes.' -- Leo Buscaglia*

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Your need for aceptance can make you invisible in this world.

Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.

> *'If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Ignore what others may be thinking of you, because they aren’t.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'You've gotta dance like there’s nobody watching.' -- William W. Purkey*

### How to overcome shame?

> *'Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.' -- Tyrion*

> *'Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

The cure for shame is honesty.

When you try to hide something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness.

### On confidence
	
> *'The less confident you are, the more serious you have to act.' -- Tara Ploughman*

> *'The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence.' -- Charles Bukowski*

Shame is the opposite of confidence. Confidence is shamelessness. 

Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker.

> *'Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction.' -- Bobby Sommer*

### How to bust confidence?

Honesty is the pathway to confidence. Hiding creates shame.

Hints:

- Hard work, mastery and core values are good sources of pride. When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets.  
- Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked.  
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech. If you don’t believe you are good, you'll never be good.
- It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.
- The space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel.

### On arrogance and entitlement

> *'Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity.' -- Amy Cuddy*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, but being jealous and insecure does.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.  
- I’m worse than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.

> *'Don’t be so humble - you are not that great.' -- Golda Meir*




---
## On limits, resistance and motivation

> *'We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.' -- Archilochus*

> *'To define is to limit.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Your limits are where are your [fears](#on-fear-anger-and-excuses).  

Impostor syndrome: your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. We live in a society where the greatest lies that are told are the ones that we tell ourself. There are few actual rules. The police aren’t coming for you. No one is watching you. Do what you want.

### On lazyness

Lazyness is resting before getting tired.

### How to break through your resistances?

Lots of people keep telling themselves old stories and patterns that aren’t serving them.

- Don’t be afraid of taking a step back.  
- Break down your dreams/goals into achievable steps.  
- Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation.

However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

### How to bust motivation?

- Don’t look for inspiration. Look for irritation.
- Sometimes is a matter of money. Sometimes is a matter of «burning bridges»

> *'With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how».' -- Tony Robbins*

> *'There was a gun to my head. The gun was, I didn’t want to be in an assisted living home, watching TV all day, waiting to die. Every day I wake up with that gun to my head. Every day I live.'*




---
## On pessimism

> *'That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be.' -- James Jones*

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.' -- Bertram Carr*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset. Optimism is rarely the way but pessimism is never the way. 

> *'The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.' -- William Arthur Ward*

> *'There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, ‘Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything,’ and an optimist who says, ‘Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way.’ Either way, nothing happens.' -- Yvon Chouinard*

> *'Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper.' -- Francis Bacon*

Anyway, on the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.' -- Mark Manson*

> *'Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.' -- Nat Friedman*




---
## On perfectionism

> *'The perfect is the enemy of the good.' -- Voltaire*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you can derive success. From perfection you derive procastination, anxiety and depression. 

See yourself as a doist, not a perfectionist. This is liberating.

> *'Think of your life merely as a long sequence of actions and decisions. If you’re like most people, many of these actions and decisions are sub-optimal. And what most of us mean when we say we’d like to “change” ourselves is simply that we’d like to make slightly more optimal actions and decisions. Keep your “self” out of your decisions, because most likely, it’s not about “you”. Simply ask yourself, “Is this a good thing to do?” Yes? Then go do it.' -- Mark Manson*

> *'Perfectionism doesn’t make you feel perfect; it makes you feel inadequate.' -- Maria Shriver*

> *'No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It’s unlikely that you’ll be the first.' -- Andy Hunt*

> *'The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men.' -- George Eliot*

> *'Something does not need to be perfect to be wonderful. Especially weddings.' -- Kevin Kelly*
