# 1.1 - On foundations

## On autonomy

<!--
> *"We all have enough strength to endure the misfortunes of other people."  
-- La Rochefoucauld*

- Don’t build your castle in other peoples kingdom’s
- Freedom to -> freedom from -- naval
- Bees don’t waste their time explaining to flies that flowers taste better than shit.
-->

> *"A man is free at the instant he wants to be."  
-- Voltaire*

Your autonomy is your major legacy.

Once we’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.
  
Stop being codependent or others and start caring for yourself first. The money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Telling *your* truth is not selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you be able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

> *"I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself."  
-- Rita Mae Brown*

> *"I can’t give you the formula for success, but  Ican give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody."  
-- Herbert Swope*

> *"That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second."*

> *"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"What we reason for ourselves may help others. What we reason for others will not help us." (...)  
"If you hurt people because of their expectations of you, that’s their problem."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

> *"Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt."  
-- Dan Kariv*

> *"Never explain: your friends do not need it, and your enemies will not believe you anyway."  
-- Elbert Hubbard*

> *"Care about other people think and you will always be their prisoner."  
-- Lao Tzu*

## On authenticity

<!--
- Honesty is an antidote to impostor syndrome. 
- CHANGE YOUR ACTIONS, NOT YOURSELF. Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change. truth-a-better-way-to-talk-about-ourselves.
- You must play by your rules, funnel your weird stuff to give you some advantage.
- 5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction (integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)
- Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life. Part of being a man is getting shit done. A real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
- Core values: honesty everywhere. I dont want to be in place where I can’t be honest. I want to make relationships with a long term prospect. Flat hierarchy. I don’t want to be around hierarchical systems, I want to treat everybody as a peer. I don’t want to be around angry people.
- I approve of me. I am my word. I keep my word / I take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.
- Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
- You are shaped by how you see others seeing you
- Personal branding will kill you. Personal DOING will save everyone around you. People justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.
-->

> *"I’d rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not."  
-- Kurt Cobain*

> *"When we see truth in a person we call it authenticity."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don’t need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.

If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate to you. Just be real, and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to excel at everything. Find your context. You don’t need to suceed in every context.

> *"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently."  
-- Warren Buffett*

Take ownership of your life; only then you will cultivate respect for yourself and earn respect from others. Your choices have determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *"Be the person your dog thinks you are."  
-- J.W. Stephens*

> *"We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change."

### How to grow your reputation?

Be impeccable with your word. Take responsibility. Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life.

-- Lao Tsu*

> *"Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

## On humility

> *"The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk."  
-- Cicero*

Modesty means being comfortable that others will discover your greatness.

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect, and you’ll never be. Success means nothing in life; it’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. On the other hand, your emotional health lives on for hundreds of generations in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

One way to humble yourself is to place yourself in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

> *"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"Virtue signaling is popular because it lets anyone, regardless of objective merit, go on an ego trip."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On respect

> *"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t."  
-- Bill Nye*

You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch but what you probably want is respect and admiration from your peers.

> *"Promptness is a sign of respect."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

> *"You will earn the respect of all if you begin earning the respect of yourself."  
-- Rufus*

### On gratitude

> *"If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough."  
-- Oprah Winfrey*

You opened two gifts this morning: your eyes.

Being grateful is looking up. Play the cards you are dealt. And sometimes you will be dealt bad cards.

Don’t forget that a group of people blazed the trail we’re enjoying, and another group continues to maintain it.

> *"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."  
-- Cicero*

> *"Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude."  
-- Anne Frank*

-- Mark Manson*

> *"Writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest possible therapy ever."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The blind can’t see. The proud will not."  
-- Unknown*

> *"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich." (...)  
"When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be. When I let go of what I have, I receive what I need."  
-- Lao Tzu*

### How to apologise?

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

> *"It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

## On agency

> *"The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."  
-- Confucius*

Blessed are the restless.

Hints:

- Help with a precise thing («I can drop a lasagna at 4:00.») instead of «I’m here for you». Helpful people don’t ask «how can I help». They just help.
- «It’s on documentation. If it’s not add it.»

# 1.2 - On growth

## On comfort and risk

> *"If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

You can choose courage or comfort, but you can’t choose both.

The size of your life is directly proportional to how much discomfort you are willing to endure. You keep doing what you’re good at to avoid confronting the real problems in your life. Breaking rules can be frightening, but comfort is the enemy of achievement. You’ll never achieve what you want in life without taking risks. Prioritizing risk over safety is the path to progress. If you act average, you’ll remain average. To outperform, you must be both different and correct.

Hints:

- Risk looks different for everyone.  
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you’d expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.  
- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.  
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, spend a week alone in nature. Being uncomfortable should be "play" for you. Find comfort in discomfort.  
- Being risk-prone is better than being risk-averse, but don’t allow yourself to be out of the game. Adventure comes from perceived risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can work up to scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.  
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.  
- This isn’t just a success strategy; it’s a well-being strategy. The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.  
- Stability without stagnation.

## On improving

<!--

> *"Time is the best teacher; unfortunately it kills all its students.*

-->

> *"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."  
-- Winston Churchill*

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time.

It involves the accumulation of experience, the analysis of past situations, deliberate practice, and structured knowledge.

Hints:

- Listen to someone explaining challenging techniques, and then attempt to follow their advice. Seek feedback as it accelerates learning.
- If it’s easy, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and face challenges. That’s when real learning occurs.
- Reflect on your mistakes; try to identify the cues you missed and what to look for next time.
- Repeat.

What are you really holding onto that is holding you back. 2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle. 3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?
- Don’t waste time on more than learning more than a handful of conjugations for primarily first-person singular (I) and second-person singular (you) in the past, present, and future tenses, along with common phrases that illustrate them. Throw in a few auxilaries (to want to V, to need to V, to like to V, etc.) Make it your goal to screw up as often as possible in uncontrolled environments. Explicitly ask friends to correct you and reward them with thanks and praise when they catch you spouting nonsense, particularly the small understandable mistakes. !!! Before you invest (or waste) hundreds and thousands of hours on a language, you should deconstruct it. !!! learn language: films, manga, phrasebook, dictionary, flashcards. Consider a new language like a new sport. analogy. advantages and train. learn conjugations for “helping” verbs like “to want,” “to need,” “to have to,” “should,” etc. In Spanish and many others, this allows you to express yourself with “I need/want/must/should” + the infinite of any verb. Learning the variations of a half dozen verbs gives you access to all verbs. This doesn’t help when someone else is speaking, but it does help get the training wheels off self-expression as quickly as possible. The apple is red. It is John’s apple. I give John the apple. I give John the apple. We give him the apple. He gives it to John. She gives it to him. I must give it to him. I want to give it to her.

### Improving by analysis

> *"Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience."

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t necessarily bring something new. Innovation comes from having a broader perspective and analyzing past situations. People often repeat the same mistakes. You improve by examining your failures; it will help you let go.

> *"You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward."

> *"Journal early before your inhibitions take in. Keep a journal to record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want."*

> *"Knowledge without action is useless. «Pathological learners» who are voracious consumers of knowledge live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it."*

Action, not knowledge, leads to success. If you are not consistently applying the new information you’re learning, then it’s merely educational porn.

There’s always room for improvement; be humble. There is no place for a «prima donna».

If you’re not improving today, you’re regressing. Skills are perishable, and the path to mastery is a never-ending story. Some of the skills you need to achieve expertise have not yet been systematized.

## On habits and systems

<!--
- Personality is malleable, in fact it’s so malleable we often don’t realize we’re forging a new one.
- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others. Annual review: GOOD + BAD: Health & Fitness, Business & Career, Finances, relationships, personal growth	
- Shut off all work and electronics at least 2 hours before you want to go to sleep, sit down with a pen and a notepad and write down everything that you need to achieve the following day in order of importance. write 1000 words every morning before you do anything else. Learn how to say no, or not to say yes. One new thing: learn at least one new thing everyday. Read, watch a documentary, look around, observe, engage in a conversation. Be creative: Creativity conquers jealousy, envy, self-pity and worry. 52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything. e.g. water, blueberries, green tea, avocados, leafy green vegetables, fatty fish, water, dark chocolate, flax seeds and nuts
- you do not raise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- endurance is more relevant than toughness
-->

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
-- Will Durant*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits. Habits are like compound interest in real life.

Consistency doesn’t result from effort; it comes from showing up. Long-term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life. 

> *"At any given time, I’m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit." (...)  
"It isn’t 10k hours that creates outliers, it’s 10k iterations." (...)  
"I probably read 1-2 hours a day, and that puts me in the top 0,00001%."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential."  
-- Winston Churchill*

> *"First we make our habits, then our habits make us."  
-- Charles C. Nobel*

> *"People don’t decide their future, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures."  
-- F. M. Alexander*

> *"Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are to heavy to be broken."  
-- Warren Buffett*

### How to change habits?

> *"Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things."  
-- Charles Duhigg*

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.  

Hints:

- Try to break a bad habit and form a good one every 6 months. (Naval Ravikant)
- Avoid low-leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and negative bias), pointless notifications, social media (use it for output, not entertainment; other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning or the last thing at night), owning a TV, overworking, unhealthy relationships, judgment, micromanagement, perfectionism, virtue signaling.
- Cultivate high-leverage habits: develop useful skills, exercise, rest, meditate, travel, read, journal, enjoy music, create, network, make friends, spend time outdoors with friends and family, indulge in massages, practice gratitude, forgive, prioritize self-awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, prioritize sleep and naps, smile, and embrace colors.
- Small steps are more likely to lead to success. For example, if you find resistance to meditating for 15 minutes, try starting with just five minutes.
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making an agreement with someone that includes financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to reinforce new habits.
- Don’t strive for perfection. Having a few vices makes life more interesting.
- Pay attention, correct your course and don’t judge.

- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.

> *"If you are depressed you are living in the past.   
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present."  
-- Lao Tzu*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

- Depression (under-stimulation) can be viewed as a lack of self-expression. It may arise when one feels powerless or dominated, leading to chronic stress as a way to stimulate oneself.
- Anxiety (over-stimulation) manifests as hypersensitivity and can be linked to our evolutionary need for control. Anxiety isn’t productive planning; it’s a continuous state of apprehension over various scenarios. Worrying about the unknown is unproductive; we have limited control and primarily influence rather than dictate outcomes. Stress often results from excessive concern, and worrying is a misuse of the imagination. The past exists only in your thoughts; what truly matters is the present and the future.

> *"Boredom is a soul sucker. The unfed mind devours itself."  
-- Gore Vidal*

> *"When people don’t express themselves, they die one piece at a time."  
-- Laurie Halse Anderson*

> *"Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom."

### How to overcome them?

> *"If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play."  
-- Jason Nemer*

Action cures everything. Physical stress avoids need for control.

Hustling (the right amount of stimulation) involves consistently stretching your comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.  

Hints:

- The best antidepressant is knowing that we matter to others. People don’t die from suicide; they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to reduce the need for control. When you’re feeling stressed out, take a moment to breathe. Remember that body language affects your psychology, mood, and even hormonal balance. People tend to be naturally happier when they’re kept busy.
- Diet is also relevant: *debug* your body as much as you can.

## On fear, anger and excuses

<!--
- anger is a punishment we give ourselves for someone else’s mistake
- the hardest prison to escape is in your own mind.
-->

> *"We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light."  
-- Plato*

Fear is paralyzing. Fear does not stop death, it stops life. 

When you view everything through the lens of fear, you’re more likely to remain in retreat mode. Anger and excuses often mask underlying fears. Remember that all excuses can be challenged. The best years of your life are the ones in which you take ownership of your problems rather than blaming them on your family, the environment, or the president. Living in reality requires less energy than cultivating a victim mentality. Escaping reality drains your energy. What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown. fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.

> *"Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

### How to overcome fear?

> *"We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them."  
-- Christian Nestell Bovee*

Replace fear with curiosity. Conquering fear means defining fear.

Fear makes the wolf bigger than he really is.  

> *"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood."  
-- Marie Curie*

> *"Fear is incomplete knowledge."  
-- Agatha Christie*

> *"It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves."  
-- Sir Edmund Hillary*

> *"A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears."  
-- Montaigne*

> *"Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; ha can anger you only you permit yourself being disturbed by him."  
-- Epictetus*

### On courage

> *"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage."  
-- Anaïs Nin*

> *"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear — not absence of fear."  
-- Mark Twain*

A coward has no scar.

Heros and cowards feel the same fear but their answers are different. Courage implies low reverence. Courage is a form of intelligence not strenght. It’s about outwitting your limiting beliefs, irrational fears and insecurities.

> *"Without courage there cannot be truth, and without truth there can be no other virtue."  
-- Sir Walter Scott*

> *"All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle."  
-- Francis of Assisi*

> *"Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing."  
-- Edmund Burke*

> *"Courage charms us, because it indicates that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world, that he is thinking neither of his bed, nor his dinner, nor his money, but will venture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it."  
-- Albert Camus*

> *"Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice."  
-- Ayaan Hirsi Ali*

> *"It’s better to be a restrained monster than a well-behaved coward."  
-- Jordan Peterson*

> *"Troops would never be deficient in courage, if they could only know how deficient in it their enemies were."  
-- Duke of Wellington*

> *"It is courage that vanquishes in war, and not good weapons." (...)  
"He who loses wealth loses much; he who loses a friend loses more; but he that loses his courage loses all."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes*

> *"Courage makes a man more than himself; for he is then himself plus his valor."  
-- William R. Alger*

> *"Knowledge without courage is sterile."  
-- Baltasar Gracián*

> *"Courage is grace under pressure."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"Courage is the complement of fear. A man who is fearless cannot be courageous. (He is also a fool.)"
-- Robert A. Heinlein*

### How to increase courage?

> *"Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage."  
-- Lao Tzu*

> *"Fear is a reaction. Courage is a decision."  
-- Wiston Churchill*

> *"Courage is doing what you are afraid to do. There can be no courage unless you are scared."  
-- Eddie Rickenbacker*

> *"Courage ought to be guided by skill, and skill armed by courage."  
-- Sir P. Sidney*

> *"A man of courage is also full of faith."  
-- Cicero*

> *"Tell a man that he is brave, and you help him become so."  
-- Thomas Carlyle*

## On failure, mistakes and scars

> *"Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Fail fast and bounce back quickly.

Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax.

> *"Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment."  
-- Jim Horning*

> *"The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one."  
-- Elbert Hubbard*

> *"We’re even wrong about which mistakes we’re making."  
-- Carl Winfeld*

> *"If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure." (...)  
"When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail."  
-- A.J. Jacobs*

> *"It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it."  
-- Lou Holtz*

> *"There is no failure, only feedback." (...)  
"Most of our suffering comes from avoidance."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"There are only two kinds of people who fail: those who listen to nobody... and those who listen to everybody."  
-- Thomas Beshere, Jr.*

> *"Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour."  
-- Truman Capote*

> *"It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk*

### On scars

> *"A life spent making mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful, than a life spent doing nothing."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

Don’t punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.

> *"Sorrow is better than fear. Fear is a journey, a terrible journey. But, sorrow is at least an arriving."  
-- Alan Paton*

> *"It’s not just other people we need to forgive. Sometimes we need to forgive ourselves."  
-- Mitch Albom*

> *"You’re going to make mistakes in life. It’s what you do after the mistakes that counts."  
-- Brandi Chastain*

> *"Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."  
-- Mary Oliver*

> *"Your pain, is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding." (...)  
"Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars."  
-- Kahlil Gibran*

> *"A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole."  
-- China Mieville*

> *"The scars you acquire by exercising courage will never make you feel inferior."  
-- Giovanni Battista Cima*






---
## On shame, confidence and validation

> *"Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."  
-- Andre Malraux*

> *"Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."  
-- Brene Brown*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide. The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings compensate insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure. 

> *"I was ashamed of myself when I realized that life was a costume party; and I attended with my real face."  
-- Franz Kafka*

> *"The greater the outward show, the greater the inward poverty."  
-- J. Krishnamurti*

> *"Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure."  
-- Alan Watts*

### On confidence and validation

> *"Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes."  
-- Leo Buscaglia*

> *"Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction."  
-- Bobby Sommer*

Confidence is the opposite of shame. Confidence is shamelessness. 

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker.

Hints:

- Too many people undervalue what they are and overvalue what they are not. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. 
- To get self-aceptance you have to do the unconfortable things that you know you are right. When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets. It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- Confidence markers: the space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel. Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked. The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you don’t believe you are good, you’ll never be good. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech.
- Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.
- Not being insecure about an unattractive quality instantly makes you way more attractive. Generally the thing you’re most ashamed of is actually your biggest strenght/asset but you haven’t figured out how to use it.
- Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.
- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
- Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness.
- Confidence come from some success. You need some accomplishment to get there.
- Everything you’re running away is in your head. We hold on to something so tight because we fear something so great won’t happen twice.
- Money problems are self-confidence problems.

> *"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence."  
-- Charles Bukowski*

> *"Guilt is society’s voice speaking in your head." (...)  
"Self-esteem is just the reputation you have with yourself. You’ll always know."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Self-confidence is the memory of success."  
-- David Storey*

### How to overcome shame and grow confidence?

> *"Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."  
-- Tyrion*

Honesty is the pathway to confidence.

When hiding something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it.

> *"Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them."  
-- Augusten Burroughs*

> *"The less confident you are, the more serious you have to act."  
-- Tara Ploughman*

> *"Just get out of the room."  
-- Robert Glover*

### On entitlement

> *"Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity."  
-- Amy Cuddy*

> *"Rudeness is the weak person’s imitation of strength."  
-- Eric Hoffer*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, being jealous and insecure does.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody so I deserve special treatment.  
- I’m worse than everybody so I deserve special treatment.






---
## On limits and motivation

> *"We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training."  
-- Archilochus*

Your fears define your limits.  

Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development. 

> *"To define is to limit."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer*

### How to get motivation?

> *"With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how»."  
-- Tony Robbins*

Lazyness is resting before getting tired.

Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Most people keep telling themselves old stories that aren’t serving them.

> *"There was a gun to my head. The gun was, I didn’t want to be in an assisted living home, watching TV all day, waiting to die. Every day I wake up with that gun to my head. Every day I live."
-- Unknown (tetraplegic)*

> *"Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going."  
-- Jim Rohn*






---
## On jealousy

Jealousy is the face of low self-esteem.






---
## On pessimism

> *"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."  
-- William Arthur Ward*

> *"There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, «Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything», and an optimist who says, «Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way». Either way, nothing happens."  
-- Yvon Chouinard*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

Pessimism is seductive. Optimism sounds like a sales pitch, pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
While optimism is not always the way, pessimism is rarely the way. On the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

Hints:

- Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than oportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.
- Entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic beacuse they are rewarded by being optimistic. Intelectuals for being pessimistic.

> *"Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper."  
-- Francis Bacon*

> *"That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be."  
-- James Jones*

> *"A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty."  
-- Bertram Carr*

> *"While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path."  
-- Mark Manson*

> *"Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money."  
-- Nat Friedman*

> *"Worry gives small things a big shadow."  
-- Unknown*

> *"I’m always looking for a way to make it happen, not excuses why it won’t work."  
-- Aaron Walker*

> *"Both optimists and pessimists contribute to society. The optimist invents the aeroplane, the pessimist the parachute."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

> *"Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. The honest way to critique is to create the alternative." (...)  
"To see if they really think that things are getting worse, ask them if they’d rather live in the future or in the past."  
-- Naval Ravikant*






---
## On self awareness

> *"No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld*

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind. It reduces the gap between who you are and who you think you are.   

> *"The best mirror is an old friend."  
-- George Herbert*

> *"Weeds are flowers too, once you get to know them."  
-- A.A. Milne*

> *"The things we see every day are the things we never see at all."  
-- G.K. Chesterton*

> *"Conscience is the inner voice that warns us somebody may be looking."  
-- H.L. Mencken*

> *"I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others."  
-- Marcus Aurelius*

### How to grow self awareness?

> *"People who can’t laugh at themselves will always be outwitted by people who can."  
-- T.K. Coleman*

> *"Your growth as a conscious being is measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? So why would you be different?  

Hints:

- Meditation makes you more mindful. Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less reactive and enable you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings.
- Ask questions to challenge your assumptions: «What if I’m wrong about this?»

## On perfectionism

-- Caroline Myss*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you derive success. From perfection you derive procastination, anxiety and depression. It’s liberating to see yourself as a «doist».
