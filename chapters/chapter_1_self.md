# 1.1 - On foundations

## On autonomy

<!--
> *"I’m a warrior, so that my son may be a merchant, so that his son may be a poet."  -- John Quincy Adams [1767]*

- Bees don’t waste their time explaining to flies that flowers taste better than shit.
- Cutting off people who drained my energy. Reading more than I scrolled. Lifting weights instead of lifting burdens that weren’t mine. Choosing discipline over dopamine. And realizing this harsh truth: You don’t need more time. You need fewer distractions. Do that early and your life levels up ruthlessly fast.
- Don’t build your castle in other peoples kingdom’s
- Freedom to -> freedom from -- naval
- when you don’t want to be interesting you are free. -- moojy
-->

> *"A man is free at the instant he wants to be."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

Your autonomy is your major legacy.

Once you’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.

Stop being codependent of others and start caring for yourself first. The money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Hints:

- Telling *your* truth is not selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you be able to serve others to your fullest capacity.
- Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

> *"Care about other people think and you will always be their prisoner."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"If you begin by sacrificing yourself to those you love, you will end by hating those to whom you have sacrificed yourself."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"I can’t give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody."  
-- Herbert Swope [1882]*

> *"Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt."  
-- Nikos Kazantzakis [1883]*

> *"Whenever you think or you believe or you know, you’re a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you’re nobody-but-yourself."  
-- E.E. Cummings [1894]*

> *"I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself."  
-- Rita Mae Brown [1944]*

"If you hurt people because of their expectations of you, that’s their problem."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On honesty
<!-- or authenticity!

- 5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction (integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)
- Core values: honesty everywhere. I dont want to be in place where I can’t be honest. I want to make relationships with a long term prospect. Flat hierarchy. I don’t want to be around hierarchical systems, I want to treat everybody as a peer. I don’t want to be around angry people.
- Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
- You are shaped by how you see others seeing you.
- tetris taught me that when you try to fit in, you’ll disappear.
-->

> *"When we see truth in a person we call it authenticity."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

Hints:

- If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate to you. Just be real, and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to excel at everything. Find your context.
- If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don’t need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.
- Honesty is an antidote to impostor syndrome.
- Truth is a better way to talk about ourselves. Personal branding will kill you. People justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.

> *"No legacy is so rich as honesty."  
-- William Shakespeare [1564]*

> *"He who dares not offend cannot be honest."  
-- Thomas Paine [1737]*

> *"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

> *"The man to lies to himself can be more easily offended than any other."  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky [1821]*

> *"It is better to be hated for what you are than to be loved for what you are not."  
-- André Gide [1869]*

> *"Nobody realizes that some people expend tremendous energy merely to be normal."  
-- Albert Camus [1913]*

> *"Always be a first rate version of yourself and not a second rate version of someone else."  
-- Judy Garland [1922]*

> *"Inside every cynical person, there is a disappointed idealist."  
-- George Carlin [1937]*

> *"Being honest may not get you a lot of friends but it’ll always get you the right ones."  
-- John Lennon [1940]*

> *"Always be radically honest, but use your honesty as a gift not as a weapon. Your honesty should benefit others."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Escape competition through authenticity." (...)  
"What the world craves is authenticity." (...)   
"To be honest speak without identity."
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Anything you loose by being real was fake."  
-- Kanye West [1977]* 

### On accountability

<!--
- every damn thing is your own fault, if you are any good.
- chi sei? sono l’evoluzione di tutti i miei errori.
- Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life. Part of being a man is getting shit done. A real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
- I approve of me. I take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax. Change your actions, not yourself. Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change. 
-->

> *"We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change."  
-- Katharine Hepburn [1907]*

You are your word.

Take responsibility. Only then you will cultivate respect for yourself and earn respect from others. Your choices have determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *"Commitment is what transforms a promise into a reality."  
-- Abraham Lincoln [1809]*

> *"Be the person your dog thinks you are."  
-- J.W. Stephens [1834]*

> *"Commitment is an act, not a word."  
-- Jean-Paul Sartre [1905]*

> *"Whenever you think that some situation or some person is ruining your life, it’s actually you who are ruining your life. It’s such a simple idea. Feeling like a victim is a perfectly disastrous way to make go through life."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

> *"I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me."  
-- S.E. Hinton [1948]*

> *"Truth only means something when it’s hard to admit."  
-- Nicholas Sparks [1965]*

> *"Without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it’s a relationship, a business or a hobby."  
-- Neil Strauss [1969]*

> *"Make two people proud: your 8-year-old self and your 80-year-old self."  
-- x@david_perell*

### On trust and reputation

<!--
- A person who trusts no one now, once trusted someone too much.
-->

> *"It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life.

> *"There is no greater fraud than the promise not kept."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Who does not trust enough will not be trusted."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

-- Margaret Mitchell [1900]*

"When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"If you worry about your reputation you don’t deserve to have one."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Your character starts out spotless. You can only stain it." (...)  
"The selfish reason to be ethical is that it attracts the other ethical people in the network." (...)  
"Integrity is when what you think and what you say and what you do are one." (...)  
"Returns are made on the way up. Reputations are made on the way down." (...)  
"Living a life of integrity pays off, but it takes a very long time." (...)  
"Before you can lie to another, you must firt lie to yourself." (...)  
"Intentions don’t matter. Actions do. That’s why being ethical is hard."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Fame is a lagging indicator of distinctiveness. Reputation is a lagging indicator of trustworthiness."  
-- x@rapahelz*






## On humility

<!--
- Humility With forward action: "I wasn’t the smartest in X but.."  
-->

> *"The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk."  
-- Cicero [-106]*

Modesty means being comfortable that others will discover your greatness.

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect, and you’ll never be. Success means nothing in life; it’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. On the other hand, your emotional health lives on for hundreds of generations in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

One way to humble yourself is to place yourself in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

> *"Do not speak of your happiness to one less fortunate than yourself."  
-- Plutarch [0046]*

> *"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."  
-- Ernest Hemingway [1899]*

> *"Humility is mostly about being very honest about how much you owe to luck."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Virtue signaling is popular because it lets anyone, regardless of objective merit, go on an ego trip."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"The highest form of humility is being teachable."  
-- x@rapahelz*

> *"You learn more from other people if you pretend you know less than them."  
-- x@alexhormozi*

### On respect

<!--
- I roamed as a kid. Always respectful to people and places we were at. Now, kids are so badly mannered and have zero respect for people’s things- If I don’t respect him, I’ll disrespect him. Nothing in between..
- Normalize ghosting girls at the first sign of disrespect.
- Respect isn’t earned anymore. It’s auctioned to the highest bidder.
- They don’t respect you at the bottom, they ignore you in the middle, and they hate you at the top. You’ll never have everyone’s approval. So it’s best to just focus on what you’re doing.
- you can't force someone to respect you, but you can refuse to be disrespected.

### On gratitude

> *"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."  
-- Cicero [-106]*

You opened two gifts this morning: your eyes. Play the cards you are dealt. And sometimes you will be dealt bad cards.

Being grateful is looking up. Don’t forget that a group of people blazed the trail we’re enjoying, and another group continues to maintain it.

"The day a blind man sees, the first thing he throws away is the stick that has helped him all his life."

-- Benjamin Franklin [1706]*

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

### On agency

<!--

- Help with a precise thing («I can drop a lasagna at 4:00.») instead of «I’m here for you». Helpful people don’t ask «how can I help». They just help.
- «It’s on documentation. If it’s not add it.»
- Without commitment, you’ll never start. Without consistency, you’ll never finish.
- You don’t need 100 self-help books, all you need is action + self-discipline.

# 1.2 - On growth

## On comfort and risk

<!--
- You think you are playing safe, but you are actually accumulating anxiety. Take bolder risks, it’s mentally liberating.
- If you want to grow as a man... Never stay in the same place for too long.
-->

> *"If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

You can choose courage or comfort, but you can’t choose both.

Comfort is the enemy of achievement. The size of your life is directly proportional to how much discomfort you are willing to endure. Breaking rules can be frightening and you keep doing what you’re good at to avoid confronting the real problems in your life. You’ll never achieve what you want in life without taking risks. Prioritizing risk over safety is the path to progress. If you act average, you’ll remain average. To outperform, you must be both different and correct. 

Hints:

- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you’d expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, spend a week alone in nature. Being uncomfortable should be «play» for you. Find comfort in discomfort.
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.
- This isn’t just a success strategy; it’s a well-being strategy. The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.
- Risk looks different for everyone. Stability without stagnation.
- Which do you want - the pain of stayng where you are, or the pain of growth?
- When the love-of-life line crosses the fear-of-death line, all hell breaks loose.

> *"When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it."

-- John C. Maxwell [1947]*

> *"Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On risk management

> *"Never test the depth of the river with both feet."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Being risk-prone is better than being risk-averse, but don’t allow yourself to be out of the game. Adventure comes from perceived risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can work up to scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.

> *"If your life is free of failures, you’re not taking enough risks."  
-- H. Jackson Brown Jr. [1940]*






## On improving

> *"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time. The accumulation of experience and the analysis of past situations will structure knowledge. 

	PROGRESS = PAIN + REFLECTION

	SKILL = EFFORT * TALENT

Hints:

- Listen to someone explaining challenging techniques, and then attempt to follow their advice. Seek feedback as it accelerates learning.
- If it’s easy and you’re not surprised, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and face challenges. That’s when real learning occurs.
- Reflect on your mistakes; try to identify the cues you missed and what to look for next time.
- Repeat.

### Improving by analysis

> *"Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience."  
-- Otto von Bismarck [1815]*

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t necessarily bring something new. Innovation comes from having a broader perspective and analyzing past situations. People often repeat the same mistakes. You improve by examining your failures; it will help you let go.

Hints:

- Fastest way to learn is to teach. Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
- Journal early before your inhibitions take in. Record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want.

> *"You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward."  
-- Steve Jobs [1955]*

### On applied knowledge

<!--
- don’t be so busy preparing for teh future that you never step into it. the satisfaction of binge consumption brings instant gratification, so whty try anything else? the problem with shoving information is the ilusion of knowledge, especially when you rush it.true learning requires comtemplation. And implementation. And a commitment to reflecting on great ideas over and over again.

> *"«Pathological learners» (...) who are voracious consumers of knowledge live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it. Knowledge without action is useless."

Action, not knowledge, leads to success. If you are not consistently applying the new information you’re learning, then it’s merely educational porn.

-->

> *"Wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one’s own advice."  
-- Sam Harris [1967]*

### On mastery

<!--
- There’s always room for improvement; be humble. There is no place for a «prima donna». If you’re not improving today, you’re regressing. Skills are perishable, and the path to mastery is a never-ending story. Some of the skills you need to achieve expertise have not yet been systematized.
-->

> *"An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field."  
-- Niels Bohr [1885]*

True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know.

> *"When you are right, you are learning nothing."*
> *"When you try something new, don’t think of it as a matter of success / failure, but as success / learning to succeed."*

- Young men could learn anything if you questify schools.
- The modern education system doesn’t create leaders. It creates followers. Escape the matrix.
- Young men could learn anything if you questify schools.
- the problem is not, and never have been, "as good as a professional". It has always been "it’s good enoughto replace a professional so it’ll be cheaper." the key thing about AI is that AI+human is waht we’ll do.

Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult. It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were. It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you. I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears. So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up."

Hints:

- Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory and persuasion.
- Believe in principles. The basics are really important, not jargon or specifics. Understand it, not memorize it. You only need to understand a few basic concepts. complexity emerges from very simple rules.
- Applied focus. This means that while you should only strive for mastery in a small handful of skills, you should seek to be competent in a wide variety of disciplines. Don’t major on minor things.
- School fails in subjects like: how to build self confidence / how to be good with money / dating and relationships skills / confrontation skills / critical thinking / creative productivity.
- Education leads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward a final self-definition.
- School rewards generalists, the world not so.
- School’s real study topic is obedience. No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them.
- Success is the worst teacher.
- The biggest mistake anyone makes when studying a foreign language is that they do it little by little, not jumping into it head first. Language is not mathematics; one doen’t need to learn it, one needs to get accustomed to it. It’s not about logic or memory; It’s about experience and skill.

> *"The strongest intellectual foundation is built upon science, math and philosophy, as they are the search for universal truths." (...)  
"Study math to understand physics. Study physics to understand chemistry. Study chemistry to understand biology. Study biology to understand psychology. Study psychology to understand economics. Study economics and philosophy to be free." (...)  
"Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory, and persuasion." (...)  
"Timeless: science, math, philosophy, rhetoric. First principles. Creating art & business. Family & lifelong friends. Habits to calm mind & body. Temporary: politics, news, estertainment. Memorizing facts. Hourly work. Transactional relationships. Drugs & doctors for mind and body." (...)  
"The ideal school would teach health, wealth and happiness. It would be self-paced and available to all. It would show opposing ideas and students would self-verify truth. No grades, no tests, no diplomas - just learning. Actually you’re already here. Careful who you follow."

## On reading

-->

> *"I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."

### On classics

> *"The great books are the books that never have to be written again."  
-- Carl Van Doren [1885]*

Don’t read the books made to make money, read the ones they want to ban. Most books are propaganda.

If you want better ideas, read better books. If you want new ideas, read old books.

> *"The worst thing about new books is that they keep us from reading the old ones."  
-- Joseph Joubert [1754]*

> *"A classic is a book which people praise and don’t read."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"I don’t believe in book recommendations lol. Reading what everyone else is already reading—especially books has minimal value (hardly a novel observation) therefore you should allocate your time differently. If everyone’s reading it, the insights are already absorbed into the zeitgeist or regurgitated online. Reading what’s obscure gives you asymmetric knowledge—potentially valuable ideas others haven’t yet mined. There’s a counter: sometimes it pays to understand why a popular book resonates. It’s less about the book itself & more about mapping the cultural moment or the biases of the masses. For this use case I just use chatgpt."

It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length.

### On email

Hints:

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS. 






## On habits and systems

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
-- Will Durant [1885]*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits. Habits are like compound interest in real life.

Consistency doesn’t result from effort, it comes from showing up. Long-term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life. Endurance is more relevant than toughness.

Hints:

- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others. Annual review: GOOD + BAD.
- You do not raise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Stop a bad behaviour by filling the space with a better one. Replacement is better than abstinence.

-- F.M. Alexander [1869]*

> *"Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential."

> *"You'll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is found in your daily routine."  
-- John C. Maxwell [1947]*

> *"The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"At any given time, I’m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit." (...)  
"It isn’t 10k hours that creates outliers, it’s 10k iterations." (...)  
"I probably read 1-2 hours a day, and that puts me in the top 0,00001%."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to change habits?

> *"Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things."  
-- Charles Duhigg [1974]*

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.

Hints:

- Try to break a bad habit and form a good one every 6 months.
- Avoid low-leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and negative bias), pointless notifications, social media (use it for output, not entertainment; other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning or the last thing at night), owning a TV, overworking, unhealthy relationships, judgment, micromanagement, perfectionism, virtue signaling.
- Cultivate high-leverage habits: develop useful skills, exercise, rest, meditate, travel, read, journal, enjoy music, create, network, make friends, spend time outdoors with friends and family, indulge in massages, practice gratitude, forgive, prioritize self-awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, prioritize sleep and naps, smile, and embrace colors.
- Small steps are more likely to lead to success. For example, if you find resistance to meditating for 15 minutes, try starting with just five minutes.
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making an agreement with someone that includes financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to reinforce new habits.
- Pay attention, correct your course and don’t judge. Don’t strive for perfection. Having a few vices makes life more interesting.

- A man complaining a lot is a man not accomplishing a lot.
- cages aren’t made of iron, they’re made of thoughts.
- It took me 13 years to realize that the only cure to depression is just leaving the house at every single possible opportunity no matter how badly you don’t want to.
- Most people are not extremes and most people are in the middle. Most things are not binary. Introvert is not shyness. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7. It’s hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.
- the heaviest burdens that we carry are the thoughts in our heads.
- The more alone a man is, the more likely he is to get into "depression". Live alone, eat alone, work alone, never go out = depression. Spend more time with people, go out in nature, lift weights, and eat good food - no depression.
- the only thing complaining does is convince other people that you are not in control.
- Turns out I wasn’t depressed, I just needed a job that fulfills me, a «date to marry» relationship, a consistent physical activity and high protein whole foods nutrition.
- we don’t have anxiety for things we think we can handle!
- what is poison? anything beyond what we need is poison. it can be power, laziness, food, ego, ambition, vanity, fear, anger, or whatever.
- you can’t heal if you keep pretending you’re not hurt.
- You know a nigga depressed once he starts going on walks.

> *"If you are depressed you are living in the past.  
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

- Depression (under-stimulation) can be viewed as a lack of self-expression. It may arise when one feels powerless or dominated, leading to chronic stress as a way to stimulate oneself.
- Anxiety (over-stimulation) manifests as hypersensitivity and can be linked to our evolutionary need for control. Anxiety isn’t productive planning; it’s a continuous state of apprehension over various scenarios. Worrying about the unknown is unproductive; we have limited control and primarily influence rather than dictate outcomes. Stress often results from excessive concern, and worrying is a misuse of the imagination. The past exists only in your thoughts; what truly matters is the present and the future.

Hints:

- The two best doctors: Mr. Outdoors (sunshine, water, air, exercise) and Mrs. Diet.
- Stress is who you think you should be. Peace is who you are. As I began to love myself, my relationship with everyone changed.
- Financial health is just as important as physical health. Nothing feels as good as having a «fuck you» fund.
- Therapy (awareness of past) / Spirituality (awareness of present) / Yoga (awareness of future)
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
- Anxious persons feel the only way to achieve relaxed certainty is getting new info but the more you know the more you’ll realize you don’t know.
- Avoiding anxiety leads to more anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
- Thinking about it makes it worse. Writing about it makes it better.
- Burnout is an oversaturation of the sameness.
- No purpose attracts depression. Unemployment makes you unhappy. Dot.
- Seeds of doubt grow into forests of inaction.
- The hardest prison to escape is in your own mind. Depression hates a moving target.

-- Jason Nemer [1978]*

Action cures everything. Physical stress eliminates the need for control.

Hustling (the right amount of stimulation) involves consistently stretching your comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.

Hints:

- The best antidepressant is knowing that we matter to others. People don’t die from suicide; they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to reduce the need for control. When you’re feeling stressed out, take a moment to breathe. Remember that body language affects your psychology, mood, and even hormonal balance. People tend to be naturally happier when they’re kept busy. Exercise is a celebration of what your body can do not a punishment for what you ate.
- Diet is also relevant: *debug* your body as much as you can.

## On fear

<!--
> *"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose."  -- Yoda*

- What would you do if you weren’t afraid?
- dishonesty is a reaction to fear. fear just wants us to stay the same.
- climbing out the hole is about letting go of pride.
-->

> *"We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light."  
-- Plato [-427]*

Fear is paralyzing. Fear does not stop death, it stops life. 

When you view everything through the lens of fear, you’re more likely to remain in retreat mode. Anger and excuses often mask underlying fears. Remember that all excuses can be challenged. The best years of your life are the ones in which you take ownership of your problems rather than blaming them on your family, the environment, or the president. Living in reality requires less energy than cultivating a victim mentality. Escaping reality drains your energy. What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown. fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.

> *"Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

### How to overcome fear?

> *"We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them."  
-- Christian Nestell Bovee [1820]*

Replace fear with curiosity. Conquering fear means defining fear.

Fear makes the wolf bigger than he really is.

> *"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood."  
-- Marie Curie [1867]*

> *"Where you fear is, there your task is." (...)  
"That which we need the most will be found where we least want to look."

> *"The cave you fear to enter, holds the treasure you seek."  
-- Joseph Campbell [1904]*

> *"It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves."  
-- (sir) Edmund Hillary [1919]*

### On courage

<!--
> *"He who jumps into the void owes no explanation to those who stand and watch."
+ x@naval -- Because, as Taleb says, courage is the only virtue that can’t be faked.

- bravery is learned -> micro-bravery, start small
-->

> *"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage."  
-- Anaïs Nin [1903]*

A coward has no scar.

Heros and cowards feel the same fear but their answers are different. Courage implies low reverence. Courage is a form of intelligence not strenght. It’s about outwitting your limiting beliefs, irrational fears and insecurities.

> *"All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle."  
-- St. Francis of Assisi [1181]*

> *"It is courage that vanquishes in war, and not good weapons." (...)  
"He who loses wealth loses much; he who loses a friend loses more; but he that loses his courage loses all."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes [1547]*

> *"Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing."  
-- Edmund Burke [1729]*

> *"Troops would never be deficient in courage, if they could only know how deficient in it their enemies were."  
-- (1st duke of Wellington) Arthur Wellesley [1769]*

> *"Without courage there cannot be truth, and without truth there can be no other virtue."  
-- (sir) Walter Scott [1771]*

> *"Courage charms us, because it indicates that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world, that he is thinking neither of his bed, nor his dinner, nor his money, but will venture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

> *"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear — not absence of fear."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

-- Robert A. Heinlein [1907]*

> *"Those who lack the courage will always find a philosophy to justify it."  
-- Albert Camus [1913]*

> *"Speak your mind, even if your voice shakes."

-- Jordan Peterson [1962]*

> *"Fear is a reaction. Courage is a decision."

-- Eddie Rickenbacker [1890]*

> *"The Roman army rule: action removes fear."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*






## On failure

> *"Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Fail fast and bounce back quickly.

A failure is a man who has blundered but is not capable of cashing in on the experience. Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax. We should fear missing opportunity more than we should fear failure.

Smart people aren’t used to failing, so they struggle to learn from their mistakes and often respond by blaming someone else.

> *"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."  
-- Confucius [-551]*

> *"All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride."  
-- Sophocles [-497]*

> *"There are two types of people that fail: those that listen to nobody and those that listen to everybody"  
-- J.P. Morgan [1837]*

> *"The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one."  
-- Elbert Hubbard [1856]*

> *"A life spent making mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful, than a life spent doing nothing."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"Failure is only the opportunity to begin again more intelligently."  
-- Henry Ford [1863]*

> *"Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour."  
-- Truman Capote [1924]*

> *"It’s not the load that breaks you down, it’s the way you carry it."  
-- Lou Holtz [1937]*

> *"Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment."  
-- Jim Horning [1942]*

> *"If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure." (...)  
"When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk [1963]*

> *"You’re going to make mistakes in life. It’s what you do after the mistakes that counts."  
-- Brandi Chastain [1968]*

> *"Calling it an experiment gives you permission to fail."  
-- A.J. Jacobs [1968]*

> *"Failure is irrelevant unless it is catastrophic."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

> *"We’re even wrong about which mistakes we’re making."  
-- Tim Hartford [1973]*

> *"There is no failure, only feedback." (...)  
"Most of our suffering comes from avoidance."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"I’m not afraid of failure, I’m afraid of being in the exact same place next year."  
-- x@thejustinwelsh*

### On anger

> *"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you."  
-- Bob Harris (fictional)*

Anger is a punishment we give ourselves for someone else’s mistake.

Hint: 

- Pay attention to what people say out of anger, they’ve been dying to tell you that.
- Most angry people are envious people who don’t understand that life will only get better once they are focused on their own lives and actively improving who they are.

> *"An angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes."  
-- Cato the Younger [-095]*

> *"And God said «love your enemy», and I loved myself."  
-- Kahlil Gibran [1883]*

### On scars and wounds

<!--
- i don’t hide my scars. they are proof that i showed up for life. and fought.
- if you don’t heal what hurt you, you’ll bleed on people who didn’t cut you.
-->

> *"A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole."  
-- China Mieville [1972]*

Don’t punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.

> *"In anger we should refrain both from speech and action."  
-- Pythagoras [-570]*

> *"The scars you acquire by exercising courage will never make you feel inferior."  
-- Cima da Conegliano [1459]*

> *"Adversity makes men, and prosperity makes monsters."

-- Alan Paton [1903]*

> *"Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."  
-- Mary Oliver [1935]*

> *"It’s not just other people we need to forgive. Sometimes we need to forgive ourselves."  
-- Mitch Albom [1958]*

> *"Words can’t hurt you, they can only hurt your image of you."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On shame, confidence and validation

<!--
- Do what scares you until it doesn’t.
- How you view yourself is how people will view you.
- humble enough to know i’m replaceable. cocky enough to know is a downgrade.
- Normalize this. Normalize that. How about you feel shame for once?
- People with low self-esteem protect themselves by not taking risks. High self-esteem gives you the power of confidence to take chances.
- you cannot live when you are untouchable. Life is vulnerability.
-->

> *"Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."  
-- Brené Brown [1965]*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide. The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings compensate insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure. 

> *"I was ashamed of myself when I realized that life was a costume party; and I attended with my real face."  
-- Franz Kafka [1883]*

> *"The greater the outward show, the greater the inward poverty."  
-- J. Krishnamurti [1895]*

> *"Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."  
-- Andre Malraux [1901]*

> *"The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change."  
-- Carl Rogers [1902]*

> *"Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure."  
-- Alan Watts [1915]*

### On confidence and validation

<!--
- Confidence in public comes from discipline in private.
- I can see in his eyes whether he’s confident about himself.
- I can tell if his confidence is fake. Real confidence is like an aura, calm assuredness. Fake confidence is loud, annoying and needy.
- If her words can hurt you Then you are WEAK
- People who lack self-confidence love to make fun of others and denigrate their success, that’s how they feel better about themselves, don’t take it personally.
- The more confident a man is, the slower he will talk
- you’re so busy doubting yourself while so many others are intimidated by your potential.
-->

> *"Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction."  
-- Bobbe Sommer [1936]*

Confidence is the opposite of shame. Confidence is shamelessness. 

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker.

Hints:

- Too many people undervalue what they are and overvalue what they are not. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. 
- To get self-aceptance you have to do the unconfortable things that you know you are right. When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets. It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- Confidence markers: the space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel. Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked. The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you don’t believe you are good, you’ll never be good. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech.
- Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.
- get confidence: impress yourself
- Not being insecure about an unattractive quality instantly makes you way more attractive. Generally the thing you’re most ashamed of is actually your biggest strenght/asset but you haven’t figured out how to use it.
- Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.
- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
- Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness.
- Confidence come from some success. You need some accomplishment to get there.
- Everything you’re running away is in your head. We hold on to something so tight because we fear something so great won’t happen twice.
- Money problems are self-confidence problems.
- Confident people don’t crave attention.

"Seek validation through creation, not through appreciation." (...)  
"You are a story you tell yourself."

### How to overcome shame and grow confidence?

> *"Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."  
-- Tyrion {fiction}*

Honesty is the pathway to confidence.

When hiding something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it.

> *"Just get out of the room."  
-- Robert Glover [1955]*

### On entitlement and ego

<!--
- People will tolerate a bit of arrogance if you are talented and still young; but once you get older, you understand that you could have attracted many more opportunities if you had had the intelligence to learn humility earlier in life.
-->

> *"Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity."  
-- Amy Cuddy [1972]*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, being jealous and insecure does.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody so I deserve special treatment.
- I’m worse than everybody so I deserve special treatment.

### On addictions

<!--
- Porn isn’t real sex. Cocaine isn’t real energy. Alcohol isn’t real courage. Gambling isn’t real investing. Nightly news isn’t real facts. Social media isn’t really social. Business books aren’t real business.
- signs of a man who has lost control of his life: watch porn. addicted to comfort. addicted to drugs and alcohol. spend all day indoor.
- So many men lose themselves trying to make an ungrateful woman happy.
-->

> *"The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly sallary."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

Nietzsche describes 3 modern vices: OVERWORK (to be constantly busy is self-negation. It betrays a «will to forget» oneself), CURIOSITY (vague curiosity about everything, without deep obsessions, goes nowhere), SYMPATHY (sympathy for all means a refusal to rank good and bad).

> *"Addiction to knowledge is like any other addiction. It offers an escape from the fear of emptiness, of loneliness, of frustration, the fear of being nothing."  
-- x@k__quotes*

### On introversion

> *"You think you are an introvert because you like being alone. But in reality you just love being in peace. And you’re actually extroverted around people who bring you peace."  
-- x@zacharylaid*

There are no introverts, only people that don't feel safe.

> *"Intellectualism is a common cover-up for fear of direct experience."  
-- Carl Jung [1875]*

> *"Smart people are so good at discovering their own flaws but so mid at actually fixing them. Is the solution to most of their problems just experimental drugs or getting a job in sales?"  
-- x@anuatluru*

> *"Introverts, being "too nice" is not kindness, it’s a trauma response. Where does this come from? For many, it starts in childhood: Growing up in unpredictable environments; having to please parents to avoid punishment or neglect; believing your worth depends on keeping others happy. This behavior becomes survival."  
-- x@karunpal*

> *"The introvert/extrovert dichotomy has always struck me as a bit silly. People generally gain energy spending time with people they feel they can be their authentic selves around. They generally spend energy being around people they feel they can’t."  
-- x@kaseyklimes*






## On jealousy and envy

<!--
- A inveja mata-nos. O sucesso dá-nos vida!
- Humans hate the most successful humans as it makes their little egos feel inferior.
-->

> *"You’ll never be criticized by someone who is doing more than you. You’ll always be critized by someone who is doing less. Remember that."  
-- Denzel Washington [1954]*

Envy is a sign that you are not focused on your life.

Jealousy is the face of low self-esteem. An healthy mind does not speak ill of others.

Outliers inspire envy. Once they stop talking to you, they start talking about you. Intelligence, wealth, fame, luck, beauty, health, sucess and lifestyle (freedom) are the main triggers.

Treat haters like toddlers. When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours. Only take advice from those achieving what you want to achieve. Ignore and be flattered by the rest. Never hate people who are jealous of you. Respect their jealousy - they think that you’re better than them. If someone is copying you, you won. Jealousy comes in jokes, pay attention.

> *"Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people."

-- Marilyn Monroe [1926]*

> *"It is not greed that drives the world, but envy."

> *"Think as you like but behave like others." (...)  
"Never appear too perfect." (...)  
"If people with natural gifts also possess a good work ethic and have some luck in life, envy will follow them wherever they go."

> *"If someone’s insults bother you; it is evidence that you respect him."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *Choose inspiration over envy." (...)  
"The only people worth envying are the ones incapable of envy."   
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

> *"They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself."  
-- x@tevsmith*

However beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy. When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.

> *"There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing."  
-- Aristotle [-384]*

> *"Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

### On empathy

> *"Empathy without boundaries is self destruction."  
-- x@khoucasian*

Honesty witout empathy is brutality. Empathy without honesty is manipulation.

> *"That which we are capable of feeling, we are capable of saying."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes [1547]*

> *"Someone could be more successful than you and still envy you because your character carries more weight than their status."  
-- x@pallnandi*






## On pessimism

> *"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."  
-- William Arthur Ward [1921]*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

Pessimism is seductive. Optimism sounds like a sales pitch, pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
While optimism is not always the way, pessimism is rarely the way. On the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

Hints:

- Entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic because they are rewarded by being optimistic. Intelectuals the opposite.
- You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic.
- Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than oportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.

> *"Both optimists and pessimists contribute to society. The optimist invents the aeroplane, the pessimist the parachute."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"Keep you thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your thoughts positive because your words become your behaviour. Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits becomes your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi [1869]*

> *"I’m always looking for a way to make it happen, not excuses why it won’t work."  
-- Aaron Walker [1910]*

> *"There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, «Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything», and an optimist who says, «Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way». Either way, nothing happens."  
-- Yvon Chouinard [1934]*

> *"You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Complaints don’t deliver complaints, they mostly reveal your weakness."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. The honest way to critique is to create the alternative." (...)  
"To see if they really think that things are getting worse, ask them if they’d rather live in the future or in the past." (...)  
"It’s good to be optimistic in the general and skeptical in the specific. It’s very dangerous to be pessimistic in the general and optimistic in the specific."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path."  
-- Mark Manson [1984]*

> *"That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be."

### On worry

> *"Worry gives small things a big shadow."  
-- vox populi*

Worrying is worshipping the problem. If you panic, panic early.

> *"If something is wrong fix it. But train yourself not to worry, worry fixes nothing."  
-- Ernest Hemingway [1899]*






## On perfectionism

> *"Perfectionism is the fear of being criticized."  
-- Caroline Myss [1952]*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you derive success. From perfection you derive procastination, anxiety and depression. It’s liberating to see yourself as a «doist».

> *"The perfect is the enemy of the good."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men."  
-- George Eliot [1819]*

### On procrastination

<!--
- i think procrastination leads to burnout much more than work does.
- Just finished the book «Buy Back Your Time». Key takeaway? Outsource your weaknesses. It isn’t lazy, it’s smart. Double down on your zone of genius and watch your business, health and life transform.
- Laziness is just a symptom of not having something worth waking up for. It’s a lack of direction. When your goals align with your passions, laziness fades away because you’re driven by something bigger than yourself. Purpose fuels progress. It’s about building something that outlasts you.
- Laziness is often disguised as a lack of knowledge.
- One pattern I’ve noticed in all miserable people: They overthink and underact.
- You’re too gifted to be paralyzed by procrastination. Dear son, I need you to focus.
-->

> *"One of the counterintuitive things that I’ve learned is that procrastination is often a side-effect of perfectionism."  
-- hn@bane*

We fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all. Inadequacy of results makes us realize that we are not as good as we think we are and creates anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us. We procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety. When hope disappears, so does action. The cost of procrastination is the life you could’ve lived.

Hints:

- What gets measured gets done.
- Don’t wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet. You will languish if you stop for a long time and paralysis is worse than bad timing.
 At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused (the panic monster). 
- However, never mistake action for motion. You must think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought. So make a plan. Any plan will do.

> *"Evil is whatever distracts."  
-- Franz Kafka [1883]*

> *"The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it." (...)  
«Learning more» is the most seductive form of procrastination. «Planning more» is the second most."

> *"What’s well begun is half done."  
-- Horace [-065]*

### On clutter

> *"Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination."  
-- x@authorcscalise*

Hints:

- Remove unnecessary distractions and obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals. Technology is your slave, not your master. You’re not choosing ignorance, you’re choosing to not watch wrestling.
- Minimalism doesn’t avoid possession. Only excess. The less you own, the less owns you. Owning less is better than organizing more. Eliminate instead of organizing. Organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling. Actively declutter makes room for your true treasures and clarify your values. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need. Storage is a way of warehousing the past. If you don’t love it or use it is clutter. Decluttering is self-care. Clutter is not just physical stuff. It’s old ideas, toxic relationships and bad habits. Clutter is everything that doesn’t support the better self.
- Use it or loose it. A tool is useful when passes human level. Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
- Buy supplies before you need them. Gadgets after you need them. Three is two. Two is one. One is none.
- All that clutter used to be money.

> *"If a little is not enough for you, nothing is."

## On limits

<!--
- we are wired to blame: we blame ourselves or teh others. we are obsessed with fault.
- the fears we don’t face become our limits.
-->

> *"We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training."  
-- Archilochus [-680]*

Your fears define your limits.

Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

-- Brene Brown [1965]*

### On motivation

> *"With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how»."  
-- Tony Robbins [1960]*

Everyone is motivated until the 4AM alarm, then it’s discipline.

Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Most people keep telling themselves old stories that aren’t serving them. Lazyness is resting before getting tired.

### On self awareness

> *"No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld [1613]*

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind. It reduces the gap between who you are and who you think you are. 

Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? So why would you be different?  

Hints:

- Meditation makes you more mindful. Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less reactive and enable you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings.
- Ask questions to challenge your assumptions: «What if I’m wrong about this?»

## On growing old

<!--
- As you get older, you want to simplify your life: family and friends with no drama, nutritional and exercising habits with no health risk, a neighborhood with no worry about public safety and cleanliness, time online with no anger and outrage. A simple, but better life.
- At twenty, you think you have the whole world figured out, then with every passing year, you become more humble, you stop jumping to conclusions, you stop judging people you actually don’t know.
- Spiritual maturity begins when we feel like we have to stop taking care of the world.
-->

> *"If you arrive to my age and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster."

After reaching a certain age, you are no longer seen as an individual; you become an institution and are treated as institutions are. You are expected to behave like a piece of historical furniture, an architectural landmark.

Aging implies wear and tear, often seen as a high price to pay for maturity.

-->

> *"The foundation of maturity: just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility."
