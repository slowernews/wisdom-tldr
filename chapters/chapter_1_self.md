## On independence

<!--
Codependent no more: How to stop controlling others and start caring for yourself.

Practice doing without things you think you need.
Once we’re bought, it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent.
The bank owned them. Work owned them.

3. You have to make the definite decision to succeed. The only thing separating you from your wildest dreams and ambitions is that you have not yet made the definite decision to achieve them.

- There are many yous: Like apps on a smartphone, different systems in your brain with different goals can take control at different times, which is why you can behave so inconsistently. Meditation can prevent hijacking: Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less impulsively reactive and allow you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings. Mini-meditations help in the moment: By focusing on your breath during a tense moment you can get some of the long term effects of meditation right when you need them.

- I believe in principles. the basics are really important. not jargon or specifics. understand it not memorize it. you only need to understand a few basic concepts. complexity emerges from very simple rules.

> *'A man is free at the instant he wants to be.' -- Voltaire*

Your independence is your legacy.
  
Take care of yourself first and the money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Telling *your* truth is not being selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you are able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

> *'I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself.' -- Rita Mae Brown*

> *'I can’t give you the formula for success, but I can give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody.' -- Herbert Swope*

> *'That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second.'*

> *'Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

## On authenticity

<!--
- core values: honesty everywhere. i dont want to be in place where i cant be honest. i want to make relationships with a long term prospect. flat hierarchy. i dont want to be around hierarchical systems. i want to treat everybody as a peer. angry. i dont want to be around angry people
- Personal branding will kill you. Personal DOING will save everyone around you. people justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.
- CHANGE YOUR ACTIONS, NOT YOURSELF

Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change.

i approve of me. i am my word. i keep my word / i take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax.
> *'Words are deeds.' -- Ludwig Wittgenstein*

Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life.
Part of being a man is getting shit done.
a real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction
Manhood is Defined by Your Values and Your Code
(integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)

Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
You must play by your rules, funnel your weird stuff to give you some advantage.

> *'Always be a first rate version of yourself and not a second rate version of someone else.' -- Judy Garland*

> *'To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic. If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. What you can do, however, is stop being inauthentic. 

You don't need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Then, listen to that instinct. Next, take a moment and have a laugh. Finally, you have to be willing to put your inauthenticity aside. 

If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to be great at everything. Find your context. You don’t need to suceed in every context. You’re not going to succeed at stuff you don’t want to do.

If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate with you. Just be real and the results will come.

## On accountability

<!--
> *'With enough courage, you can do without a reputation.' -- Margaret Mitchell*
- dishonesty is a reaction to fear.
- bravery is learned -> micro-bravery, start small
- Humility With forward action: 'I wasn’t the smartest in X but..'
- integrity is what you think is what you say, and the same what you do.
- being vulnerable is taking don’t be afraid of taking a risk.
- Be willing to side with the minority.

-->

> *'It takes 20 years to build a reputation and five minutes to ruin it. If you think about that, you’ll do things differently.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Be the person your dog thinks you are.' -- J.W. Stephens*

Trust, not money, is the currency of business and life. Be impeccable with your word.

> *'Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Pay every debt, as if God wrote the bill.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Quality means doing it right when no one is looking.' -- Henry Ford*

> *'Without commitment, you cannot have depth in anything, whether it’s a relationship, a business or a hobby.' -- Neil Strauss*

> *'Truth only means something when it’s hard to admit.' -- Nicholas Sparks*

> *'Look for results, not salutes.' -- Captain Michael Abrashoff*

Take extreme ownership. When are willing to swallow your pride and take ownership of your life and success, you will cultivate respect for yourself and respect from others. Your results are yours and yours alone. Your choices determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *'We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change.' --  Katharine Hepburn*

> *'I lie to myself all the time. But I never believe me.' -- S.E. Hinton*

> *'When you die you take absolutely nothing with you except your reputation.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On humbleness

<!--
- (kk) Promptness is a sign of respect.
> *'No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn't know it.' -- Paulo Coelho*
-->

> *'There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect neither you'll ever be. 

Success means nothing in life. It’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. Your emotional health, by the other hand, lives for hundreds of generations after in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

> *'Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t.' -- Bill Nye*

A way to humble yourself is to put you in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

### How to apologise

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

> *'It’s not an apology if it comes with an excuse. It is not a compliment if it comes with a request.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On gratitude

<!--
> *'Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich.' -- Lao Tzu*
Play the cards you are dealt. And you will often be dealt bad cards. Being grateful is looking down.

> *'In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity' -- Albert Einstein*
- (kk) Before you are old, attend as many funerals as you can bear, and listen. Nobody talks about the departed’s achievements. The only thing people will remember is what kind of person you were while you were achieving.
- (kk) Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better motto for most youth is “master something, anything”. Through mastery of one thing, you can drift towards extensions of that mastery that bring you more joy, and eventually discover where your bliss is.

1. Put Your Happiness Before Goals

- Most people continue to chase down their ever elusive “calling”. You know, that one thing that if they do not do it, they have wasted their entire life and skillsets on trivial activities and distractions. Allow me to share a little secret with you. This doesn’t exist.
- Most of the entrepreneurs I know love what they do, but they do not love it because they feel it is their life’s purpose.

Create Projects, Not Goals
- Clarity is the Key to All Success: without a clear roadmap for who we are and what we want to achieve, we will never find true success. You must know exactly what you want, when you want it, and why you want it. Without this clarity, you will find yourself wandering aimlessly for years, or even decades of your life and looking back, wishing that you’d had more direction.
- We know about quitting something that’s bad for you, or something you hate. But what about quitting something you love? I can tell you from experience, it leaves a lot of room for change. I still love everything I quit. But not as much as I love all this room for change._sivers
- Most 16 year olds are just using their phones to send silly snaps to their friends and watch porn. And most people waste their lives away in 9-5 jobs. It’s not an age thing.
- “We must suffer one of two pains, either the pain of discipline or the pain of regret and disappointment.”
- When you look at your bank account and don’t like what you see, you need to remember that these results were caused by your thoughts. They were caused by your beliefs, your decisions, and your values that were then projected into your reality.
- DO THE WORK: Work until your idols become your rivals. Work hard in silence. Let your silence be your noise. How much time do you consume vs produce? Are you watching others do things you could be doing if you weren’t watching them.

What do you really want?
- What do the actions of your past suggest is most important to you?
- What desires do you have that don’t align with your past behavior.
- What future path does your past behavior suggest rather than your imagination?
- If you don’t like these answers, change your existing behavior.

### How to design a life?

Mediocrity, as a goal, sucks. As a result, is OK. Lying on death bed and regretting your life is the worst that can happen to you.

The goal of life is not comfort it’s contribution. Society has tried to convince us that the ultimate goal of our lives is to increase our comfort.
But the problem with this philosophy is that no great work ever came from comfort.

> *'My mission in life is not merely to survive, but to thrive; and to do so with some passion, some compassion, some humor, and some style' -- Maya Angelou*

> *'Life is not a problem to be solved but a reality to be experienced.' -- Soren Kierkegaard*

Hints:

- Instead of trying to point yourself in the right direction, admit you have no idea what the right direction is, and try instead to be super sensitive to the winds of change. It’s ok to have working hypotheses, even though they may constrain you a bit, because they also motivate you. Especially if they become well enough known that people start to identify them with you. You have to be extra skeptical about things you want to believe, and once a hypothesis starts to be identified with you, it will almost certainly start to be in that category.  
- If you are feeling lost in life experience more things. Become unconfortable. It will improve your tolerance for risk and adversity. Almost everything that you want is on the other side of the uncomfortable and the scary.  
- Let fear be your guide. The more fear you feel, the more you will know you are on the right track.  
- What do you do for fun? What are you interested in that everybody in the world is interested in?  
- Go where you can make a difference not where you think there’s a home run.  
- When life gets blurry, just adjust your focus. Random wandering will not move you forward.
- It’s easier to ask forgiveness than to get permission.  
- Passion is made not found.  
- There’s a fable of a man stuck in a flood. Convinced that God is going to save him, he says no a passing canoe, boat, and helicopter that offer to help. He dies, and in heaven asks God why He didn’t save him. God says, “I sent you a canoe, a boat, and a helicopter!” That’s why you need to re-evaluate your old dreams to see if new means have come along. Don’t let the details distract you from your goal.

## On comfort and risk

<!--
- This is where margins of safety come in. We build them to reduce the precariousness of chance. Large margins of safety are not always possible. Sometimes they are too expensive. Sometimes they are not available. The fukushima plant could have been designed with a margin of safety to better withstand a tsunami. It wasn’t. Why? Because redundancy is expensive. That’s the trade-off. You are safer, but it costs more money. Sometimes when the stakes are low, we decide the trade-off isn’t worth it. What decisions would you make differently if you were factoring safety margins into your life? To be fair, you can’t put them everywhere. Otherwise, your life might be all margin and no living. To figure out where else you should build margins of safety into your life, think of the times you’ve been terrified and desperate. Those might be good places to start learning from experience and making the most of your second chances.
- It is very popular to be over positive or over negative about it in the media (those people are usually wrong). So keep that in mind when reading those kind of opinions.

- 'And it ought to be remembered that there is nothing more difficult to take in hand, more perilous to conduct, or more uncertain in its success, than to take the lead in the introduction of a new order of things. Because the innovator has for enemies all those who have done well under the old conditions, and lukewarm defenders in those who may do well under the new. This coolness arises partly from fear of the opponents, who have the laws on their side, and partly from the incredulity of men, who do not readily believe in new things until they have had a long experience of them. Thus it happens that whenever those who are hostile have the opportunity to attack they do it like partisans, whilst the others defend lukewarmly, in such wise that the prince is endangered along with them.' -- machiavelli, chapter 6 of _The Prince_
- risk over safety is the way to pull forward. Risk Leads to Growth and Excitement. You will live a life that is filled with more excitement and fulfillment the more you take intentional risks.
Let your fears guide you. The Things That Scare You the Most Are the Things You Most Need to Do. mitigate risks. some people just have larger comfort zones.
-->

> *'If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal.' -- Paulo Coelho*

Without breaking rules, you'll not achieve anything great.

Breaking rules frightens people but comfort is the enemy of achievement. You keep doing what you’re good at to avoid facing the real problems in your life. The size of our life is in direct proportion to how uncomfortable we are willing to be.

> *'I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones.' -- John Cage*

> *'A ship is safe in the harbor but that’s not what ships are for.'*

> *'But how can you live and have no story to tell?' -- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

You can choose courage or you can choose comfort, but you can’t choose both.  
Take risk. Big audacious risk. You’ll never get what you want in life without it.

[If you act average, you’re going to be average](chapter_2_groups.md#on-following-the-herd). To outperform, you must be different and correct.

Hints:

- The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you'd expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.
- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, go out in nature alone for a week. Being uncomfortable should be “play” for you. Get confort in disconfort.
- Risk prone is better than risk averse but dont allow to be out of the game. Adventure comes from percieved risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can build up to the scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.
- Risk looks different for everyone.

## On improving

<!--
1. You need to recognize when you’re not learning, for one thing. If it’s easy, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and have a hard time. Now you’re learning.
2. Find a mentor. Lacking that, find e.g. talk of someone explaining some hard techniques and then try to follow the advice. Even and especially if it feels clumsy at first.
3. Switch to a new job where you'll be exposed to new things. try to find a job where people do code review, feedback is how we learn faster.
5. Reflect on your mistakes, try to find what cues you missed and what you should look for next time. I've been doing this on weekly basis and I've learned a huge amount from figuring out underlying cause of what I did wrong.

- Personality is malleable, in fact it’s so malleable we often don’t realize we’re forging a new one.
- growth: get unconfortable. So adventure is more than just grist for future storytelling — it’s a way to learn optimally. And like anything that promotes self-improvement, it’s not always a comfortable process. “We need to be willing to grow,” says Jon. “We need to be willing to be uncomfortable.”

### On learning

<!--
- (kk) Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe.
- (kk) To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them.

Tony Robbins says that the quality of your life is based on the quality of the questions that you ask yourself.
If you are facing health struggles, you need to ask yourself these three questions to truly uncover the root cause of the issues in your life.
1) What Are You Holding On To?What happened in your life that you are still angry, depressed, or frustrated with? What are you really holding onto that is holding you back.
2) What is Life trying to Teach You?How can you reframe the thing that you are holding onto into something good? What is life trying to teach you through that struggle.
3) How Can I Move On?What steps do you need to take to move on with your life? Who do you need to forgive, what needs to be said, who needs to be removed from your life?

Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
I’ve started a list of advice or things I know. Perhaps things I believe I know. Some of these are lessons I’ve learned the hard way, others are lessons I’ve observed in others. This process reminds us of what’s most important and helps us to avoid making the same mistakes in the future. I will edit and add to this over time. Try making your own list and I think it will be worth your time.

- If you’re not getting better today, you’re getting worse.

on learning:
2. Classes move as slowly as the slowest student.
3-Conversation can be learned but not taught.
Somewhat like riding a bike, though unfortunately not as permanent, language fluency is more dependent on practicing the right things than learning the right things. The rules (grammar) can be learned through materials and classes, but the necessary tools (vocabulary and idiomatic usage) will come from independent study and practice in a native environment.
Separate grammar from conversation practice. I recommend choosing one school for grammar and several native books or comics to identify sticking points, which are then discussed in one-one-one language exchanges, where your partner provides examples of usage and does not explain rules.
- teachers should give you tricks.
- Classes are easily used to infinitely postpone making the thousands of mistakes necessary to achieve fluency. 
- Don’t waste time on more than learning more than a handful of conjugations for primarily first-person singular (I) and second-person singular (you) in the past, present, and future tenses, along with common phrases that illustrate them. Throw in a few auxilaries (to want to V, to need to V, to like to V, etc.)
- Make it your goal to screw up as often as possible in uncontrolled environments. Explicitly ask friends to correct you and reward them with thanks and praise when they catch you spouting nonsense, particularly the small understandable mistakes. 
- I was able to pass the Certificado de Espanol Avanzado, the most diffucult Spanish certification test in South America, in eight weeks, which is said to require near-native fluency and years of immersion. How? By following the above fixes and making more mistakes in eight weeks than most make in eight years
- It is easier, and much more time-efficient, to catch up versus keep up.

1. Days 1-7: German films with English subtitles for at least two hours each evening for one week.
2. Days 3+: 10-20 pages of dialogue-rich manga (Japanese comics, here translated into German, that can be ordered in most languages from comic stores in your target country) for 30 minutes each morning and prior to bed. I’m a big fan of One Piece.
3. On the plane: Read a phrasebook in its entirety for active recall practice of common phrases (45 minutes of study alternated with 15 minutes of rest — this takes advantage of what is called the “primacy and recency” effect).
4. Upon arrival: Continue with manga and grammar reference checks as needed, using an electronic dictionary to reactivate vocabulary from conversation that is familiar but not understood.
5. Weeks 2-3: Thirty to sixty Vis-Ed flashcards daily. This seems like a lot, but most will have been covered in steps 1-3 using active recall (English to German). Vis-Ed compiles its sets of flashcards from word frequency lists and includes sample phrases for usage. I begin flashcards after three or four days in-country.

learn conjugations for “helping” verbs like “to want,” “to need,” “to have to,” “should,” etc. In Spanish and many others, this allows you to express yourself with “I need/want/must/should” + the infinite of any verb. Learning the variations of a half dozen verbs gives you access to all verbs. This doesn’t help when someone else is speaking, but it does help get the training wheels off self-expression as quickly as possible.

## On achieving mastery

<!--
- True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know. If they find themselves outside their circle of competence, they keep quiet or simply say, “I don’t know.”
- Without a demonstrably immense superiority in skill over the novice, there can be no true experts, only laypeople with imposing credentials.

> *'The chess grand master considers no more moves than does the expert; he just knows which ones to look at.' -- Robyn Dawes*
The better players did not examine more possibilities, only better ones — just as Capablanca had claimed. The expert relies not so much on an intrinsically stronger power of analysis as on a store of structured knowledge. Ericsson argues that what matters is not experience per se but “effortful study,” which entails continually tackling challenges that lie just beyond one’s competence. (out of confort zone)!!

> *'An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field' -- Niels Bohr*

After learning the rules, break them. Only then you can achieve mastery.

> *'Masters are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over.'-- Robert Greene*

> *'A real Dj has to know how to clear the floor. To know the worse it can happen and how to come back.' -- James Altucher*

> *'Amateurs play for tricks, masters play for position.'*

And don’t stop, skills are perishable and the path to mastery a never ending story. Some of the skills that you need to achieve expertise were not yet systemised.

> *'We don’t rise to the level of our expectations; we fall to the level of our training.' -- Archilochus*

However mastery is an important trigger of arrogance. There is no place for a «prima donna» and there’s always room for improvement: be humble.

## On habits and systems

<!--
- (kk) The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth, to flossing.
- long term thinking will guarantee you an easier life.
> *'Have exactly one vice. Two is too much. None makes you boring. Drink cocktails. Beer is for uncreative people.'*
> *'However little television you watch, watch less.' -- David McCullough*

Shut off all work and electronics at least 2 hours before you want to go to sleep, sit down with a pen and a notepad and write down everything that you need to achieve the following day in order of importance.

Effort and reward have a linear relationship when the action is mindless and simple. Effort and reward have a diminishing returns relationship when the action is complex and multivariate. But when the action becomes purely psychological—an experience that exists solely within our own consciousness—the relationship between effort and reward becomes inverted. desiring a positive experience is itself a negative experience; accepting a negative experience is a positive experience.

Here are a few snippets from my own annual review:
GOOD:
Health & Fitness: I was consistent with my training regimen and I’m in the best shape of my life. I ride my bike daily and now follow a diet that is heavy in healthy fruits and vegetables and very low in meat (still love steak!). I’ve also completed my third year of daily cold showers.
Business & Career: 2017 was a record year for me. My company broke 7-figures, I expanded my team to 12 highly talented people, my podcast has grown to 4.5 million downloads and my books and courses are selling more than ever before.
Finances: This has been my best year financially, I no longer have to worry about bills or look at my bank account when I want to buy something. However, I keep a minimalist approach to my life so I rarely spend money on “things” and instead invest in my team, friends, and family.
Relationships: I dramatically improved my networking and social circle in 2017 and have enjoyed a great romantic relationship. I’m learning a lot, growing, and getting outside of my comfort zone on a daily basis.
Personal Growth: In 2017, I gained massive clarity on who I am and what I want out of life. I no longer suffer from “Guru” worship and have found a way to tailor personal growth to my life in a way that brings me more joy and fulfillment. (Goodbye “Crush it work 18 hours a day!” mentality)
BAD:
Health & Fitness: The main issue with my health and fitness in 2017 was chronic pelvic and knee pain which reduces overall quality of life. And, as I’ve expanded my network and social circle, I’ve allowed my social drinking to increase in the past few months.
Business & Career: Even though 2017 was a great year, Knowledge for Men did experience some growing pains. Early in the year, I didn’t focus heavily enough on creating systems to successfully scale the coaching side of my business and ended up overextending myself as a result. I also didn’t focus on scalable assets like books and online courses. Also an employee of mine flooded my office by accident which cost me nearly $25k in damages to the structure of the building.
Finances: Although I made plenty of money in 2017, I didn’t do very well investing that money into long-term cash flow producing assets. I’ve also struggled to keep up with taxes as my income has increased.
Relationships: Although my relationship is great, I’m still working on improving my communication with my partner so that I can show up as authentically and honestly as possible. I’ve also struggled to keep up with old friends while expanding my social circle.
Personal Growth: 2017 was the first year in nearly a decade where I didn’t do much reading. I used to read 2-3 books a month and this year I read maybe 5 books total. I also stayed very close to San Diego for the entire year and didn’t travel the way that I wanted too.

Why You Should Record Your Conversations with Strangers

99. See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others.

Hints:

- Cultivate high leverage habits: meditate, spend time outside, exercise, rest, travel, learn useful skills (making challenge = skill), read, journal, listen music, create, network and make friends, spending time w/ friends & family, massaging, remember to be grateful, lower expectations, forgiving yourself, self awareness, plan and goals (productive visualization), eat mindfully (e.g. water, blueberries, green tea, avocados, leafy green vegetables, fatty fish, water, dark chocolate, flax seeds and nuts), multitasking / focus / do less.  sleep / nap , smile, use colors  
- Avoid low leverage habits: social media, news, pointless notifications, smartphones (they are the new cigarettes), owning a TV, working long hours, bad relationships, judging, control of petty stuff, perfectionism..  
- Mental checklist of positive habits.
- Use social media as an output not as entertainment. Your phone should not be the first thing you see in the morning nor the last thing you see at night.
- It makes other people’s stories more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on outside your world. The news causes completely unnecessary stress and it’s negatively biased.
- People tend to abandon the good system they’ll follow in search of the perfect system that they will quit.

### How to create new habits?

- Small steps beat big dreams: start very small, The smaller the change you try to make to your life, the more likely you’ll actually make it. Shrink how long you’ll do something until you no longer feel resistance to it. This is a great way to integrate new habits into your life. “Could I meditate for 15 minutes? No, I feel resistance, I’m not gonna do it. Okay, what about 10? Still too long. Okay, five? Huh, I don’t feel resistance to that. I feel like I can sit for five.” Boom. Take micro/nano steps at a time. Minimize interruptions
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits. When you integrate new habits into your life, make sure you look out on the horizon for any obstacles or commitments that might get in the way of you forming new habits.  
- Get accountable: Make bad habits more expensive by making a pact with someone to introduce financial penalties for habits that are bad for you both. This helps you focus on the costs of your bad habits, instead of their rewards.  
- Reward yourself. Adopting new behaviors and habits is difficult, but providing yourself with rewards for following through with new behaviors has been shown to help you solidify new habits. Reward yourself to solidify new habits.  
- Focus on the costs of bad habits.

However variety and novelty are also important, so balance it.

## On self awareness

<!--
- self wareness: look at mirror what went well today, what went badtoday, how can i get better. what instead of why. why questions make us focus on the problem, getting emotional and stuck in the past. what not why! what can i do for change. what makes us focusing in the solution.

So take the time now to truly understand what your beliefs and patterns are in every area of life.
The better we understand that future self the easier it is to make good decisions today in order to make life better for our future selves.

self-awareness is the single greatest predictor of leadership success
1) Reflect Less, Notice More: spend less time theorizing and more time collecting data points to see patterns and trends.
2) Ask “What” Not “Why”
3) Set Goals
4) Do A Survey

SELF-AWARENESS > HUSTLE

If we cut ourselves off from the full scope of history because it makes us uncomfortable, or doesn’t fit with the cultural narrative in which we live, we reduce our ability to learn from the past and apply those lessons to the situations we are facing today.
We need to accept that people can do great things while still having flaws. Our heroes don’tr have to be perfect, and we can learn just as much from their imperfections as from their achievements.

When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability. Your tastes only narrow & exclude people. So create.

Professionals ask questions. Amateurs make statements. Closed-minded people focus more on being understood than on understanding others. They don’t want their ideas challenged and are typically frustrated that they can’t get the other person to agree with them. Open-minded people are more curious about why there is disagreement and understand that there is always the possibility that they might be biased and that it’s worth the little bit of time it takes to [listen](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-communication) the other person’s views.

Our bodies were built to hunt and gather and move, not to stay still. However, the origin of most health problems is not physical but mental.

### On depression and anxiety

<!--
- Hopelessness is the root of anxiety, mental illness, and depression. It is the source of all misery and the cause of all addiction. -- m manson
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on.
But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety.
De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
After all, the greater the opportunity one has, the greater the anxiety of somehow squandering it. Thus, we stress: we need to make better grades, to get a better job, to date more attractive people, to have cooler hobbies, to make more friends, to be more liked and more popular. Simply being content with what we have isn’t good enough anymore. In fact, for some it’s tantamount to giving up.
- Avoiding Anxiety Leads to More Anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
Social Anxiety is never the problem, but trying to avoid social anxiety is. Social Anxiety Buster #1: Fake It ‘Til You Make It. Social Anxiety Buster #2: Be Present and Listen. Social Anxiety Buster #3: Mind Your Body Language

> *'If you are depressed you are living in the past.   
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present.' -- Lao Tzu*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

-  Depression (under-stimulation) is the lack of self-expression. If you feel powerless/being dominated you will be chronically stressed to estimulate yourself. 
-  Anxiety (over-stimulation) creates hypersensitivity. Linked with our evolutionarily need of [control](chapter_3_action.md#on-control). Anxiety is not planning, anxiety is to go on continuously over any kind of scenario. Nothing is gained by worrying about «not knowing». We don’t control anything, at most we influence some stuff. Stress is caused by giving a fuck. If you are distressed by anything external, the pain is not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it; and this you have the power to revoke at any moment. Worry is a misuse of the imagination. Past is only in your head. What’s important is present and future.
- Hustling (right amount of stimulation) is to be always stretching comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.  

> *'Boredom is a soul sucker. The unfed mind devours itself.' -- Gore Vidal*

> *'When people don’t express themselves, they die one piece at a time.' -- Laurie Halse Anderson*

> *'Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.' -- Søren Kierkegaard*  

### How to overcome them?

> *'If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play.' -- Jason Nemer*

Action cures everything. Physical stress avoids need for control. Hints:

- Best antidepressant is knowing we matter to others. People do not die from suicide, they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to diminish the need of control. If you are feeling stressed out.. breathe. Body language affects your psychology, your mood, and even your hormonal balance.
- Diet is also relevant: debug your body as much as you can.

## On fear, anger and excuses

<!--
- fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.
- What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown.
-->

> *'We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light.' -- Plato*

Fear is paralyzing.

If you view everything through the lens of fear, you'll tend to stay in retreat mode. Anger and excuses are fear clothed. All excuses are refutable. The best years of your life are the ones in which you decide your problems are your own - do not blame them on your mother, the ecology, or the president. Living reality requires less energy than victim constiousness. Escaping reality sucks your energy.

### How to overcome fear?

> *'We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them.' -- Christian Nestell Bovee*

Replace fear with curiosity. Hints:

- The antidote to fear is aceptance not courage.
- Conquering Fear = Defining Fear: define your fears not your goals. Break down your fears until you figure out the truth.
- “Whenever I feel anxious in general or about something specific, I take a piece of paper and lay it out in landscape and create three columns. In the first column on the far left, I write at the top, “What are all the worst things that could happen, however absurd?” In the middle column I write, “What could I do to mitigate the horrible things from happening?” and in the far right column I write, “What could I do to get back to where I am now, if these things happen?” Tim Ferriss calls this exercise “Fear-Setting”.

> *'It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves.' -- Sir Edmund Hillary*

### On courage

<!--
> *'Courage is the most important of all the virtues because without courage, you can't practice any other virtue consistently.' -- Maya Angelou*
-->

> *'Tolerance of intolerance is cowardice.' -- Ayaan Hirsi Ali*

> *'Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage.' -- Anaïs Nin*

Heros and cowards feel the same fear but their answers are different. Courage implies low reverence.

## On mistakes, failure and regrets

<!--
- (kk) To make mistakes is human. To own your mistakes is divine. Nothing elevates a person higher than quickly admitting and taking personal responsibility for the mistakes you make and then fixing them fairly. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.
- (kk) When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress.
- (kk) If you are not falling down occasionally, you are just coasting.
> *'If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment'. -- Jim Horning*

> *'We're even wrong about which mistakes we're making.' -- Carl Winfeld*

Fail fast and bounce back quickly: sometimes you win, sometimes you learn.

Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax.

### On regrets

<!--
punishing yourself for failing. failing is learning.
-->

> *'Sorrow is better than fear. Fear is a journey, a terrible journey. But, sorrow is at least an arriving.' -- Alan Paton*

Be gentle first with yourself.

You are more than your mistakes. Your past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you. Don’t ever regret anything because regretting means wanting to forget every moment. Every moment is what makes you who you are today, every moment spent in regret is a moment wasted. Don’t waste your moments in life, you never know when you’ll stop waking up.

> *'Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift.' -- Mary Oliver*

Suffering is a temporary but essential part of life.

Making mistakes is better than faking perfections. Every difficulty carries with it a corresponding opportunity of equal size.

> *'Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars.' -- Kahlil Gibran*

## On shame, confidence and validation

<!--
- Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings, are disguises, masks, to compensate for inadequacies, physical & mental insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure.
> *'Just get out of the room.' -- Robert Glover*
> *'Ignore what others may be thinking of you, because they aren’t.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

> *'Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change.' -- Brene Brown*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide.

The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

### On validation

<!--
> *'If you can avoid seeking approval of others, your power is limitless.' -- Kevin Kelly*
- It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from us. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover. Why Self-Compassion Works Better Than Self-Esteem: Boosting your ego won’t make you feel better. Instead, try talking to yourself like you would your best friend.
- You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself.
- Seek Validation from Yourself and Yourself Only, specially men. The problem is that men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
-->

> *'Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes.' -- Leo Buscaglia*

> *'You've gotta dance like there’s nobody watching.' -- William W. Purkey*

Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special.

Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth are humble. They don’t think they’re something special. They know what they are and what they aren’t, and they’re okay with it.

### How to overcome shame?

> *'Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you.' -- Tyrion*

> *'Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them.' -- Augusten Burroughs*

Shame is created by dishonesty. The cure is honesty.

When you try to hide something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness.

### On confidence
	
<!--
> *'Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart.' -- Paulo Coelho*

- honesty is the pathway to confidence. when you hide you create shame and shamelessness overtime is a defense against low self estime.
- nobody that is busy is confident
- low self confidence is the source of all problems. all neediness is a sign of self low confidence
- The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible.
When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility. All in all, it makes your dating life 1,000 times easier and more fun to navigate.
- analogy: confidence is like a building
- Building confidence takes time and it takes effort; there are no shortcuts. To help you build confidence, you need three things: the right attitude (to believe in yourself), knowledge and experience.
- if you don’t believe you are good, you'll never be good - ef!	
- I think it is important to understand how much space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel.
- If you can show up in the world as a man who is confident in who he is and what he believes and maintain a strong congruence in your thoughts, words, and deeds, then the sky is the limit.
- Dress for the job you want, not for the one you have.

Shame is the opposite of confidence. Confidence is shamelessness. 

> *'Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction.' -- Bobby Sommer*

### How to bust confidence?

Hints:

- Confidence relies on pride. Pursue authentic pride. Hard work, mastery and core values are good sources of it.  
- Presence is confidence without arrogance, grounded enthusiasm and comfortable behavior. Authenticity can’t be faked.  
- When you break an agreement that you make with yourself, your selfestime plummets: renegociate it.  
- Confidence: state + mastery. Impress yourself. Confidence is a result, not a requirement.  
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech.

### On arrogance and entitlement

<!--
How to Enter a Room So People Take Notice
1. Do a Body Check at the Door: Stand tall, put a smile on your face, and roll your shoulders back and down so your hands are at your sides and not in your pockets.
2. Don’t Look Away! Eye contact builds trust.
3. dont hide yourself.
4. dont wait to start talking. a group or a double might be an easy place to start.
5. Keep it simple. Remember, to be interesting, you’ve got to be interested.
I do my best to always pay attention to how I am presenting myself to others everywhere I go. I do a body check every time I walk into a room and make sure to keep a high value mindset. I feel that I am a better listener now and I pay close attention to low value behaviors that try to creep back into my life. My conversations are better. People see me as a confident person and as someone they can talk to. The increased enjoyment of my life and my relationships are priceless and the investment I made in myself has already financially paid itself back several times.
9. Entitlement comes in two forms.
Form one: I’m better than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
Form two: I’m worse than everybody and therefore deserve special treatment.
They’re both forms of narcissism (because they’re both about me me me), and both are pretty much never true. Which one do you usually fall into?
-->

> *'Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity.' -- Amy Cuddy*

Understand the frontier between confidence and arrogance.

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone at all. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, but being jealous and insecure does.

> *'Don’t be so humble - you are not that great.' -- Golda Meir*

## On limits, resistance and motivation

<!--
- impostor syndrome’ mentality, because when you accept that others will always be better that you are at different things, then you will cease to compare yourself against them, but instead openly seek guidance from them.
- "Don’t look for inspiration. Look for irritation."
- motivation sometimes is just a matter of money! you dont do for x, and for 2x? and for 3x? there is a moment that you'll be motivated!
> *'With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how».' -- Tony Robbins*
“There was a gun to my head. The gun was, I didn’t want to be in an assisted living home, watching TV all day, waiting to die. Every day I wake up with that gun to my head. Every day I live.”
- burning bridges to get the motivation.

> *'We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.' -- Archilochus*

> *'To define is to limit.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Your limits are where are your [fears](#on-fear-anger-and-excuses).  

Impostor syndrome: your beliefs determine your reality. Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. We live in a society where the greatest lies that are told are the ones that we tell ourself. There are few actual rules. The police aren’t coming for you. No one is watching you. Do what you want.

### How to break through your resistances?

Lots of people keep telling themselves old stories and patterns that aren’t serving them.

- Don-t be afraid of taking a step back.  
- Break down your dreams/goals into achievable steps.  
- Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation.

However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

## On pessimism

<!--
- (kk) Over the long term, the future is decided by optimists. To be an optimist you don’t have to ignore all the many problems we create; you just have to imagine improving our capacity to solve problems.
- (kk) The universe is conspiring behind your back to make you a success. This will be much easier to do if you embrace this pronoia.

> *'That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be.' -- James Jones*

> *'A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty.' -- Bertram Carr*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

> *'Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper.' -- Francis Bacon*

> *'While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path.' -- Mark Manson*

> *'Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money.' --  Nat Friedman*

> *'The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails.' -- William Arthur Ward*

## On perfectionism

> *'The perfect is the enemy of the good.' -- Voltaire*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you can derive success.  
Try to see yourself as a doist, not a perfectionist. This is liberating.

> *'Think of your life merely as a long sequence of actions and decisions. If you’re like most people, many of these actions and decisions are sub-optimal. And what most of us mean when we say we’d like to “change” ourselves is simply that we’d like to make slightly more optimal actions and decisions. Keep your “self” out of your decisions, because most likely, it’s not about “you”. Simply ask yourself, “Is this a good thing to do?” Yes? Then go do it.' -- Mark Manson*

> *'Perfectionism doesn’t make you feel perfect; it makes you feel inadequate.' -- Maria Shriver*

> *'No one in the brief history of computing has ever written a piece of perfect software. It’s unlikely that you’ll be the first.' -- Andy Hunt*

> *'The important work of moving the world forward does not wait to be done by perfect men.' -- George Eliot*

> *'Something does not need to be perfect to be wonderful. Especially weddings.' -- Kevin Kelly*
