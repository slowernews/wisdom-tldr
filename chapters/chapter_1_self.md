# 1.1 - On foundations

## On autonomy

<!--
> *"I'm a warrior, so that my son may be a merchant, so that his son may be a poet."  
-- John Quincy Adams*

- when you don't want to be interesting you are free. -- moojy
- Freedom to -> freedom from -- naval
- Don’t build your castle in other peoples kingdom’s
- Bees don’t waste their time explaining to flies that flowers taste better than shit.
-->

> *"A man is free at the instant he wants to be."  
-- Voltaire*

Your autonomy is your major legacy.

Once we’re «bought», it’s hard to get out. While we all start out wanting more independence, we increasingly live lifestyles that make us dependent. The bank owns us. Work owns us.
  
Stop being codependent or others and start caring for yourself first. The money, love, and prosperity will follow. Energy and time are limited so every moment wasted on the affairs of others subtracts from your strength. Healthy people will respect your boundaries.

Telling *your* truth is not selfish. What is more selfless? Making sure that you are taken care of so that you can take care of others or focusing all of your energy on others until you are burnt out, angry, and depressed? You can’t give what you do not have. The first step to truly serving others is to serve yourself. Take time for yourself, allow yourself to recharge and recuperate, invest into your growth and education. Then, and only then, will you be able to serve others to your fullest capacity.

> *"I think the reward for conformity is that everyone likes you except yourself."  
-- Rita Mae Brown*

> *"I can’t give you the formula for success, but  Ican give you the formula for failure, which is: try to please everybody."  
-- Herbert Swope*

> *"That’s the problem with putting others first: you’ve taught them you come second."  
-- Unknown*

> *"Selfishness is not living as one wishes to live, it is asking others to live as one wishes to live."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"What we reason for ourselves may help others. What we reason for others will not help us." (...)  
"If you hurt people because of their expectations of you, that’s their problem."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Stand up for yourself, your friends, or your values, because at the end of the day it is better to live a short life where you face your fears. A boundary is knowing what you want and what you don’t want in a moment. E.g: «If I loved myself at a level 10 of 10, would I do this?»

> *"Freedom is not free. It is earned. It is taken. It is wrestled from the jaws of fear and uncertainty and doubt."

-- Elbert Hubbard*

> *"Care about other people think and you will always be their prisoner."  
-- Lao Tzu*

## On authenticity

<!--
> *"The man to lies to himself can be more easily offended than any other."  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky (The brother Karamazov)

- I approve of me. I am my word. I keep my word / I take nothing she says seriously, helps me relax. Change your actions, not yourself. Your identity is this made up thing that you’re emotionally attached to. It’s a mirage in the desert. And the quickest way to change yourself is to realize that there’s no real self to change. 
- 5Cs: courage, congruence, confidence, calibration, conviction (integrity, honor, service, and generosity should be at the top of your list)
- Core values: honesty everywhere. I dont want to be in place where I can’t be honest. I want to make relationships with a long term prospect. Flat hierarchy. I don’t want to be around hierarchical systems, I want to treat everybody as a peer. I don’t want to be around angry people.
- Honesty is an antidote to impostor syndrome. 
- Work for a cause, not for applause. Live life to express, not to impress. Don’t strive to make your presence noticed, just make your absence felt.
- You are shaped by how you see others seeing you.
- truth-a-better-way-to-talk-about-ourselves. Personal branding will kill you. People justify all kinds of mistakes to preserve the personal narratives they are invested in. Countries rewrite their histories, from the textbook up, to support how they see themselves now.
- Part of being a man is being a protector of everyone who comes into your life. Part of being a man is getting shit done. A real man loves problems. it’s an opportunity to do your best.
-->

> *"I’d rather be hated for who I am, than loved for who I am not."  
-- Kurt Cobain*

> *"When we see truth in a person we call it authenticity."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Authenticity isn’t the presence of something, but the absence of everything that isn’t authentic.

If you’re trying to be authentic, you’re not being authentic. You don’t need to learn how to be authentic but to un-learn inauthenticity. The first step is to notice when it arises. Next, take a moment and have a laugh.

If you try to be something you’re not, you end up being nothing. Don’t try to be perfect, people know when they’re talking to the real thing. The more vulnerable you are, the more people will be able to relate to you. Just be real, and the results will come. If something is holding you back, recognize it and fix it, but you don’t have to excel at everything. Find your context. You don’t need to suceed in every context.

Take ownership of your life; only then you will cultivate respect for yourself and earn respect from others. Your choices have determined the body, bank account, and relationships that you have right now.

> *"Be the person your dog thinks you are."  
-- J.W. Stephens*

> *"We are taught you must blame your father, your sisters, your brothers, the school, the teachers - but never blame yourself. It’s never your fault. But it’s always your fault, because if you wanted to change you’re the one who has got to change."

-- Margaret Mitchell*






---
## On humility

> *"The higher we are placed, the more humbly we should walk."  
-- Cicero*

Modesty means being comfortable that others will discover your greatness.

Ego is the unhealthy belief in our own importance. You are not perfect, and you’ll never be. Success means nothing in life; it’s forgotten in one generation, two at best. On the other hand, your emotional health lives on for hundreds of generations in the lives of everyone you touch and their descendants.

One way to humble yourself is to place yourself in the position of being the weakest person in something during the day.

> *"There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow man; true nobility is being superior to your former self."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"Virtue signaling is popular because it lets anyone, regardless of objective merit, go on an ego trip."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Humility is mostly about being very honest about how much you owe to luck."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### On respect

> *"Everyone you will ever meet knows something you don’t."  
-- Bill Nye*

You might think you want a fancy car or a nice watch but what you probably want is respect and admiration from your peers.

> *"Promptness is a sign of respect."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"No matter what he does, every person on earth plays a central role in the history of the world. And normally he doesn’t know it."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

> *"You will earn the respect of all if you begin earning the respect of yourself."  
-- Rufus*

### On gratitude

> *"If you concentrate on what you don’t have, you will never, ever have enough."  
-- Oprah Winfrey*

You opened two gifts this morning: your eyes.

Being grateful is looking up. Play the cards you are dealt. And sometimes you will be dealt bad cards.

Don’t forget that a group of people blazed the trail we’re enjoying, and another group continues to maintain it.

> *"Gratitude is not only the greatest of virtues, but the parent of all the others."  
-- Cicero*

> *"Dead people receive more flowers than the living ones because regret is stronger than gratitude."  
-- Anne Frank*

> *"When you are grateful, fear disappears and abundance appears." (...)  
"You can’t be grateful and angry simultaneously."  
-- Anthony Robbins*

> *"Comparison is the thief of joy."  
-- Theodore Roosevelt*

> *"How lucky I am to have something that makes saying goodbye so hard."  
-- A.A. Milne*

> *"A good life is not a life without problems. A good life is a life with good problems."  
-- Mark Manson*

> *"Writing down one thing you are grateful for each day is the cheapest possible therapy ever." (...)  
"You can't call it charity unless no one is watching."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The blind can’t see. The proud will not."  
-- Proverb*

> *"Knowing others is intelligence; knowing yourself is true wisdom. Mastering others is strength; mastering yourself is true power. If you realize that you have enough, you are truly rich." (...)  
"When I let go of what I am, I become what I might be. When I let go of what I have, I receive what I need."  
-- Lao Tzu*

### How to apologise?

Quickly, specifically, sincerely.

-- Benjamin Franklin*

## On agency

> *"The superior man is modest in his speech but exceeds in his actions."  
-- Confucius*

Blessed are the restless.

Hints:

- Help with a precise thing («I can drop a lasagna at 4:00.») instead of «I’m here for you». Helpful people don’t ask «how can I help». They just help.
- «It’s on documentation. If it’s not add it.»

# 1.2 - On growth

## On comfort and risk

<!--
> *"The lust for comfort murders the passions of the soul."  
-- Kahlil Gibran*
> *"If we’re growing, we’re always going to be out of our comfort zone."  
-- John Maxwell*

- which do you want - the pain of stayng where you are, or the pain of growth?
-->

> *"If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

You can choose courage or comfort, but you can’t choose both.

The size of your life is directly proportional to how much discomfort you are willing to endure. You keep doing what you’re good at to avoid confronting the real problems in your life. Breaking rules can be frightening, but comfort is the enemy of achievement. You’ll never achieve what you want in life without taking risks. Prioritizing risk over safety is the path to progress. If you act average, you’ll remain average. To outperform, you must be both different and correct.

Hints:

- Risk looks different for everyone.  
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you’d expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.  
- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.  
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, spend a week alone in nature. Being uncomfortable should be «play» for you. Find comfort in discomfort.  
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.  
- This isn’t just a success strategy; it’s a well-being strategy. The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.  
- Stability without stagnation.

> *"Do one thing that scares you everyday."  
-- Eleanor Roosevelt*

> *"When the love-of-life line crosses the fear-of-death line, all hell breaks loose."

-- Robin Williams*

> *"Anything I cannot transform into something marvelous, I let go."  
-- Anais Nin*

> *"Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible."  
-- Frank Zappa*

### On risk management

> *"Never test the depth of the river with both feet."  
-- Warren Buffett*

Being risk-prone is better than being risk-averse, but don’t allow yourself to be out of the game. Adventure comes from perceived risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can work up to scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.






---
## On improving

> *"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."  
-- Winston Churchill*

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time.

It involves the accumulation of experience, the analysis of past situations to structure knowledge and deliberate practice.

    PAIN + REFLECTION = PROGRESS

    EFFORT * TALENT = SKILL

Hints:

- Listen to someone explaining challenging techniques, and then attempt to follow their advice. Seek feedback as it accelerates learning.
- If it’s easy, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and face challenges. That’s when real learning occurs.
- Reflect on your mistakes; try to identify the cues you missed and what to look for next time.
- Repeat.

> *"The fastest way to learn is to do things the slow way."  
-- Chris Sommer (gymnastics coach)*

> *"He who asks a question is fool for five minutes. He who does not ask a question remains a fool forever."  
-- Proverb*

"I have no special talent, I’m only passionately curious." (...)  
"Once you stop learning, you start dying." (...)

"When you are right, you are learning nothing."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### Improving by analysis

> *"Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience."  
-- Otto von Bismarck*

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t necessarily bring something new. Innovation comes from having a broader perspective and analyzing past situations. People often repeat the same mistakes. You improve by examining your failures; it will help you let go.

Hints:

- Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
- Journal early before your inhibitions take in. Record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want.
- Fastest way to learn is to teach.

> *"You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward."  
-- Unknown*

### On applied knowledge

> *"Knowledge without action is useless. «Pathological learners» who are voracious consumers of knowledge live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it."*

Action, not knowledge, leads to success. If you are not consistently applying the new information you’re learning, then it’s merely educational porn.

> *"The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge."  
-- Aristotle*

> *"Seek knowledge. Knowledge and courage are the elements of greatness. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile."  
-- Balthasar Gracian*

## On mastery

<!--
> *"Quality is remembered long after the price is forgotten."  
-- Gucci*

- introverts have more probability of being an expert in their field. extraversion is not good for mastery. most people are not extremes and most people are in the middle. most things are not binary. introvert is not shyness. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7. It’s hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.

### On mastery and arrogance

There’s always room for improvement; be humble. There is no place for a «prima donna».

If you’re not improving today, you’re regressing. Skills are perishable, and the path to mastery is a never-ending story. Some of the skills you need to achieve expertise have not yet been systematized.

## On habits and systems

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
-- Will Durant*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits. Habits are like compound interest in real life.

Consistency doesn’t result from effort; it comes from showing up. Long-term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life. Endurance is more relevant than toughness.

Hints:

- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others. Annual review: GOOD + BAD.
- You do not raise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.  
- Stop a bad behaviour by filling the space with a better one. Replacement is better than abstinence.

> *"At any given time, I’m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit." (...)

> *"Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential."  
-- Winston Churchill*

> *"First we make our habits, then our habits make us."  
-- Charles C. Nobel*

> *"People don’t decide their future, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures."  
-- F.M. Alexander*

> *"Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are to heavy to be broken."  
-- Warren Buffett*

### How to change habits?

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.  

Hints:

- Try to break a bad habit and form a good one every 6 months. (Naval Ravikant)
- Avoid low-leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and negative bias), pointless notifications, social media (use it for output, not entertainment; other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning or the last thing at night), owning a TV, overworking, unhealthy relationships, judgment, micromanagement, perfectionism, virtue signaling.
- Cultivate high-leverage habits: develop useful skills, exercise, rest, meditate, travel, read, journal, enjoy music, create, network, make friends, spend time outdoors with friends and family, indulge in massages, practice gratitude, forgive, prioritize self-awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, prioritize sleep and naps, smile, and embrace colors.
- Small steps are more likely to lead to success. For example, if you find resistance to meditating for 15 minutes, try starting with just five minutes.
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making an agreement with someone that includes financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to reinforce new habits.
- Don’t strive for perfection. Having a few vices makes life more interesting.
- Pay attention, correct your course and don’t judge.

# 1.3 - On your worst enemy: yourself

## On stress and health

<!--

-- Carl Rogers*
> *"Tension is who you think should be. Relaxation is who you are."  
-- Proverb*

- what is poison? anything beyond what we need is poison. it can be power, laziness, food, ego, ambition, vanity, fear, anger, or whatever.
- an healthy mind does not speak ill of others.
- you can't heal if you keep pretending you're not hurt.
- the heaviest burdens that we carry are the thoughts in our heads.

> *"Your brain has expectations, and it doesn’t want to be wrong. So when it’s wrong, it just makes up the difference."  
-- Erik Vance*

There’s nothing more therapeutic than action.

We were built to hunt, gather, and move, not to stay still. However, the root cause of most health problems is often not physical but mental.

### On depression and anxiety

<!--
- the only thing complaining does is convince other people that you are not in control.
- cages aren't made of iron, they're made of thoughts.
- we don't have anxiety for things we think we can handle!
-->

> *"If you are depressed you are living in the past.   
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present."  
-- Lao Tzu*

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

- Depression (under-stimulation) can be viewed as a lack of self-expression. It may arise when one feels powerless or dominated, leading to chronic stress as a way to stimulate oneself.
- Anxiety (over-stimulation) manifests as hypersensitivity and can be linked to our evolutionary need for control. Anxiety isn’t productive planning; it’s a continuous state of apprehension over various scenarios. Worrying about the unknown is unproductive; we have limited control and primarily influence rather than dictate outcomes. Stress often results from excessive concern, and worrying is a misuse of the imagination. The past exists only in your thoughts; what truly matters is the present and the future.

<!--
- having to go to school on your birthday and everyone pointing it out.
- can i ask you a question? 99% people get frightened.
-->

Hints:

- The two best doctors: Mr. Outdoors (sunshine, water, air, exercise) and Mrs. Diet.
- Stress is who you think you should be. Peace is who you are. As I began to love myself, my relationship with everyone changed.
- Financial health is just as important as physical health. Nothing feels as good as having a «fuck you» fund.
- Therapy (awareness of past) / Spirituality (awareness of present) / Yoga (awareness of future)
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
- Anxious persons feel the only way to achieve relaxed certainty is getting new info but the more you know the more you’ll realize you don’t know.
- Avoiding anxiety leads to more anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
- Thinking about it makes it worse. Writing about it makes it better.
- Burnout is an oversaturation of the sameness.
- No purpose attracts depression. Unemployment makes you unhappy. Dot.
- Seeds of doubt grow into forests of inaction.
- The hardest prison to escape is in your own mind. Depression hates a moving target.

### How to overcome them?

<!--
- you cannot live when you are untouchable. Life is vulnerability.
-->

> *"If I had to prescribe two things to improve health and happiness in the world, it’s movement and play."  
-- Jason Nemer*

Action cures everything. Physical stress eliminates the need for control.

Hustling (the right amount of stimulation) involves consistently stretching your comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.  

Hints:

- The best antidepressant is knowing that we matter to others. People don’t die from suicide; they die from sadness.
- Exercise: burn extra calories to reduce the need for control. When you’re feeling stressed out, take a moment to breathe. Remember that body language affects your psychology, mood, and even hormonal balance. People tend to be naturally happier when they’re kept busy. Exercise is a celebration of what your body can do not a punishment for what you ate.
- Diet is also relevant: *debug* your body as much as you can.

## On fear and excuses

<!--
> *"the best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he's in prison."  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*
> *"The eyes do not see what the mind does not want."  
-- Proverb*

- What would you do if you weren't afraid?
- dishonesty is a reaction to fear. fear just wants us to stay the same.
- climbing out the hole is about letting go of pride.
-->

> *"We can easily forgive a child who is afraid of the dark; the real tragedy of life is when men are afraid of the light."  
-- Plato*

Fear is paralyzing. Fear does not stop death, it stops life. 

When you view everything through the lens of fear, you’re more likely to remain in retreat mode. Anger and excuses often mask underlying fears. Remember that all excuses can be challenged. The best years of your life are the ones in which you take ownership of your problems rather than blaming them on your family, the environment, or the president. Living in reality requires less energy than cultivating a victim mentality. Escaping reality drains your energy. What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown. fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.

> *"Don’t give in to your fears. If you do, you won’t be able to talk to your heart."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

### How to overcome fear?

> *"We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them."  
-- Christian Nestell Bovee*

Replace fear with curiosity. Conquering fear means defining fear.

Fear makes the wolf bigger than he really is.  

> *"Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood."  
-- Marie Curie*

> *"Fear is incomplete knowledge."  
-- Agatha Christie*

> *"It’s not the mountain we conquer but ourselves."

> *"A man who fears suffering is already suffering from what he fears."  
-- Montaigne*

> *"Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; ha can anger you only you permit yourself being disturbed by him."  
-- Epictetus*

> *"Where you fear is, there your task is." (...)  
"That which we need the most will be found where we least want to look."  
-- Carl Jung*

### On courage

> *"Life shrinks or expands in proportion to one’s courage."  
-- Anaïs Nin*

> *"Courage is resistance to fear, mastery of fear — not absence of fear."  
-- Mark Twain*

A coward has no scar.

Heros and cowards feel the same fear but their answers are different. Courage implies low reverence. Courage is a form of intelligence not strenght. It’s about outwitting your limiting beliefs, irrational fears and insecurities.

> *"Without courage there cannot be truth, and without truth there can be no other virtue."  
-- Sir Walter Scott*

> *"All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle."  
-- Francis of Assisi*

> *"Evil will prevail if good men stand back and do nothing."  
-- Edmund Burke*

> *"Courage charms us, because it indicates that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world, that he is thinking neither of his bed, nor his dinner, nor his money, but will venture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind."

> *"Courage is the complement of fear. A man who is fearless cannot be courageous. (He is also a fool.)"  
-- Robert A. Heinlein*

## On failure, mistakes and anger

<!--
> *"When you accept yourself, the whole world accepts you."  
-- Lao Tzu*
> *"The more you live like you are already who you want to become, the faster it will turn into a reality."  
-- Cory Allen*
-->

> *"Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Fail fast and bounce back quickly.

A failure is a man who has blundered but is not capable of cashing in on the experience. Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax. We should fear missing opportunity more than we should fear failure.

Smart people aren’t used to failing, so they struggle to learn from their mistakes and often respond by blaming someone else.

> *"Good judgment comes from experience. Experience comes from bad judgment."  
-- Jim Horning*

> *"A life spent making mistakes is not only more honourable, but more useful, than a life spent doing nothing."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

> *"The greatest mistake you can make in life is to continually be afraid you will make one."  
-- Elbert Hubbard*

> *"We’re even wrong about which mistakes we’re making."  
-- Carl Winfeld*

> *"All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride."  
-- Sophocles*

> *"If something fails where you thought it would fail, that is not a failure." (...)  
"When crisis and disaster strike, don’t waste them. No problems, no progress."

"Most of our suffering comes from avoidance."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"There are only two kinds of people who fail: those who listen to nobody... and those who listen to everybody."  
-- Thomas Beshere, Jr.*

> *"Failure is the condiment that gives success its flavour."  
-- Truman Capote*

> *"It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. We have no scar to show for happiness. We learn so little from peace."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *"You’re going to make mistakes in life. It’s what you do after the mistakes that counts."  
-- Brandi Chastain*

### On anger

<!--
> *"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you."  
-- Bob Harris (Lost in translation)*

- Pay attention to what people say out of anger, they've been dying to tell you that.
-->

Anger is a punishment we give ourselves for someone else’s mistake.

### On scars

> *"A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole."  
-- China Mieville*

Don’t punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you.

> *"The scars you acquire by exercising courage will never make you feel inferior."  
-- Giovanni Battista Cima*

> *"It’s not just other people we need to forgive. Sometimes we need to forgive ourselves."

> *"Sorrow is better than fear. Fear is a journey, a terrible journey. But, sorrow is at least an arriving."  
-- Alan Paton*

> *"In anger we should refrain both from speech and action."  
-- Pythagoras*

### On empathy

<!--
- honesty witout empathy is brutality. empathy without honesty é manipulação
-->

> *"Empathy without boundaries is self destruction."  
-- Silvy Khoucasian*

### On worry

<!--
if you panic, panic early!
-->

Worrying is worshipping the problem.

> *"If something is wrong fix it. But train yourself not to worry, worry fixes nothing."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

### On expectations

> *"Expectations are resentments waiting to happen."  
-- Brene Brown*

## On shame, confidence and validation

<!--
- Do what scares you until it doesn't.
- humble enough to know i'm replaceable. cocky enough to know is a downgrade.
-->

> *"Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."  
-- Andre Malraux*

> *"Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."  
-- Brene Brown*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide. The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. 

Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings compensate insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure. 

> *"I was ashamed of myself when I realized that life was a costume party; and I attended with my real face."  
-- Franz Kafka*

> *"The greater the outward show, the greater the inward poverty."  
-- J. Krishnamurti*

> *"Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure."  
-- Alan Watts*

### On confidence and validation

<!--
- get confidence: impress yourself
-->

> *"One who believes in himself has no need to convince others."  
-- lao Tzu*

> *"Value yourself. The only people who appreciate a doormat are people with dirty shoes."  
-- Leo Buscaglia*

> *"Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction."  
-- Bobby Sommer*

Confidence is the opposite of shame. Confidence is shamelessness. 

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker.

Hints:

- Too many people undervalue what they are and overvalue what they are not. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. 
- To get self-aceptance you have to do the unconfortable things that you know you are right. When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets. It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- Confidence markers: the space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel. Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked. The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you don’t believe you are good, you’ll never be good. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech.
- Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.
- Not being insecure about an unattractive quality instantly makes you way more attractive. Generally the thing you’re most ashamed of is actually your biggest strenght/asset but you haven’t figured out how to use it.
- Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.
- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
- Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness.
- Confidence come from some success. You need some accomplishment to get there.
- Everything you’re running away is in your head. We hold on to something so tight because we fear something so great won’t happen twice.
- Money problems are self-confidence problems.

> *"The problem with the world is that the intelligent people are full of doubts while the stupid ones are full of confidence."  
-- Charles Bukowski*

> *"Guilt is society’s voice speaking in your head." (...)  
"Self-esteem is just the reputation you have with yourself. You’ll always know." (...)  
"Ego is false confidence, self-respect is true confidence."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Self-confidence is the memory of success."  
-- David Storey*

### How to overcome shame and grow confidence?

> *"Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."  
-- Tyrion*

Honesty is the pathway to confidence.

When hiding something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it.

> *"Imperfections are attractive when their owners are happy with them."  
-- Augusten Burroughs*

> *"The less confident you are, the more serious you have to act."  
-- Tara Ploughman*

> *"Just get out of the room."  
-- Robert Glover*

### On entitlement and ego

> *"Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity."  
-- Amy Cuddy*

> *"Rudeness is the weak person’s imitation of strength."  
-- Eric Hoffer*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, being jealous and insecure does.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody so I deserve special treatment.  
- I’m worse than everybody so I deserve special treatment.

> *"The first part of life is devoted to forming an healthy ego. The second half is going inward and letting go of it."  
-- Carl Jung*






---
## On jealousy and envy

<!--
- Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.
-->

> *"You’ll never be criticized by someone who is doing more than you. You’ll always be critized by someone who is doing less. Remember that."  
-- Denzel Washington*

> *"Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people."  
-- Henry Thomas Buckle*

Jealousy is the face of low self-esteem.

Treat haters like toddlers. When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours. Only take advice from those achieving what you want to achieve. Ignore and be flattered by the rest. Never hate people who are jealous of you. Respect their jealousy - they think that you’re better than them. If someone is copying you, you won.

Outliers inspire envy. Once they stop talking to you, they start talking about you. Intelligence, wealth, ambition, fame, luck, beauty, health, freedom and a mix of them (lifestyle) are the main triggers.

> *"Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence." (...)  
"If A is a success in life, then A = X + Y + Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you are two steps ahead."  
-- Fannie Flagg*

> *"They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself."  
-- Te’ V. Smith*

> *"Think as you like but behave like others." (...)  
"Never appear too perfect."  
-- Robert Greene*

> *"Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasn’t that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you."  
-- Marilyn Monroe*

> *"The dogs bark but the caravan moves on."  
-- Proverb*

> *"It is not greed that drives the world, but envy."  
-- Warren Buffet*

> *Choose inspiration over envy."    
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On blindspots

However beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy. When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.

> *"Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*






---
## On pessimism

<!--
> *"Keep you thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your thoughts positive because your words become your behaviour. Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits becomes your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi*
-->

> *"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."  
-- William Arthur Ward*

> *"There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, «Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything», and an optimist who says, «Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way». Either way, nothing happens."  
-- Yvon Chouinard*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

Pessimism is seductive. Optimism sounds like a sales pitch, pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
While optimism is not always the way, pessimism is rarely the way. On the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

Hints:

- Entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic because they are rewarded by being optimistic. Intelectuals the opposite.
- Organisms that treat threats as more urgent than oportunities have a better chance to survive and reproduce.

> *"Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper."  
-- Francis Bacon*

> *"That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be."  
-- James Jones*

> *"A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty."  
-- Bertram Carr*

> *"While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path."  
-- Mark Manson*

> *"Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money."  
-- Nat Friedman*

> *"Worry gives small things a big shadow."  
-- Proverb*

> *"I’m always looking for a way to make it happen, not excuses why it won’t work."  
-- Aaron Walker*

> *"Both optimists and pessimists contribute to society. The optimist invents the aeroplane, the pessimist the parachute."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

> *"Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. The honest way to critique is to create the alternative." (...)  
"To see if they really think that things are getting worse, ask them if they’d rather live in the future or in the past."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"You'll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic."  
-- Kevin Kelly*






---
## On perfectionism

> *"Perfectionism is the fear of being criticized."  
-- Caroline Myss*

> *"The perfect is the enemy of the good."  
-- Voltaire*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you derive success. From perfection you derive procastination, anxiety and depression. It’s liberating to see yourself as a «doist».

> *"Have no fear of perfection. You’ll never reach it."  
-- Salvador Dali*

> *"Perfectionism doesn’t make you feel perfect; it makes you feel inadequate."  
-- Maria Shriver*

> *"I myself am made entirely of flaws, stitched together with good intentions."  
-- Augusten Burroughs*

## On self awareness

> *"No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld*

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind. It reduces the gap between who you are and who you think you are.   

> *"The best mirror is an old friend."  
-- George Herbert*

> *"Weeds are flowers too, once you get to know them."  
-- A.A. Milne*

> *"The things we see every day are the things we never see at all."  
-- G.K. Chesterton*

> *"Conscience is the inner voice that warns us somebody may be looking."  
-- H.L. Mencken*

> *"I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinion of himself than on the opinion of others."  
-- Marcus Aurelius*

> *"Until you make the uncouncious conscious, it will direct your life and you will call it fate."  
-- Carl Jung*

### How to grow self awareness?

> *"People who can’t laugh at themselves will always be outwitted by people who can."  
-- T.K. Coleman*

> *"Your growth as a conscious being is measured by the number of uncomfortable conversations you are willing to have." (...)  
"A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? So why would you be different?  

Hints:

- Meditation makes you more mindful. Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less reactive and enable you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings.
- Ask questions to challenge your assumptions: «What if I’m wrong about this?»

> *"Self-awareness is the most attractive trait." (...)  
"Meditation is a good way to measure where you are." (...)  
"Meditation is intermittent fasting for the mind. Distractions are to mind the same as sugar to body." (...)  
"The best meditation is being curious about the contents of your own mind." (...)  
"You are a story you tell yourself." (...)  
"A fit mind is a clear mind."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"If you correct your mind, the rest of your life will fall into place."  
-- Lao Tzu*






---
## On limits and motivation

> *"We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training."  
-- Archilochus*

Your fears define your limits.  

Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development. 

> *"To define is to limit."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Every man takes the limits of his own field of vision for the limits of the world."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer*

-- Muhammad ALi*

### How to get motivation?

> *"With a strong enough «why», you can overcome any «how»."  
-- Tony Robbins*

Lazyness is resting before getting tired.

Often our productivity struggles are caused not by a lack of efficiency, but a lack of motivation. Most people keep telling themselves old stories that aren’t serving them.

> *"There was a gun to my head. The gun was, I didn’t want to be in an assisted living home, watching TV all day, waiting to die. Every day I wake up with that gun to my head. Every day I live."  
-- Unknown (tetraplegic)*

> *"Motivation is what gets you started. Habit is what keeps you going."  
-- Jim Rohn*

-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Nothing is more disgraceful than that an old man should have nothing to show to prove that he has lived long, except his years."  
-- Seneca*

After reaching a certain age, you are no longer seen as an individual; you become an institution and are treated as institutions are. You are expected to behave like a piece of historical furniture, an architectural landmark.

> *"Every one desires to live long, but no one would be old."  
-- Jonathan Swift*

> *"My life was sharply divided in two halves. In the first half, I was always the youngest in the group; in the second half, I was always the oldest. Theer was no transitional period."  
-- Stan Ulam*

-- John Cassavetes*

> *"When you’re young, you have so much time but never enough money. When you’re old you have money but never enough time."  
-- Jon Boorman*

Aging implies wear and tear, often seen as a high price to pay for maturity.

-- Jean Cocteau*

> *"Once I was beautiful, now I’m myself."  
-- Anne Sexton*

-- Victor Hugo*

### On maturity

-- Kevin Kelly*

The advantage of aging is that you become more decisive. Maturing is realizing that many things don’t need your comments.

> *"We mature with the damage, not with the years."  
-- Mateus William*

> *"That is the great fallacy: the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public."  
-- Bryan White*

-- Proverb*

### How to slow down the aging process?

> *"A man that lives from memories becames old. One that lives from projects remains young."  
-- Bruno Munari*

People my age are so much older than me.

> *"We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

> *"You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"It takes a very long time to become young."  
-- Pablo Picasso*

> *"An honest man is always a child."  
-- Socrates*

-- Kevin Kelly*

# 1.4 - On envy triggers

## On talent

<!--
> *"Intelligence is curiosity. It is that and only that. If you are curious, you are intelligent. If you are not curious, you are not intelligent. In
fact, politically correct be damned, I will say it straight: A general lack of curiosity is a general lack of intelligence. I will even go so far as to say that a general lack of curiosity is the worst of all traits." (...)  
*"Curiosity is a form of creation."  
-- Zan Perrion*
-->

> *"The difference between sounding smart and being smart is «I don’t know»." (...)  
"The real test of intelligence is if you get what you want from life."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction."  
-- Ernst F. Schumacher*

Talent is fragile and it’s the most sensitive envy trigger. To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays

Intelligence is a spectrum, a dog is intelligent also.

> *"I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that’s not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile."  
-- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination." (...)  
"The measure of intelligence is the ability to change."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"Intelligence is like a river: the deeper it is, the less noise it makes."  
-- Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*

> *"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."  
-- Isaac Asimov*

### On geniality

> *"In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer*

> *"Most geniuses prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities."  
-- Andy Benoit*

> *"Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet."  
-- Bob Marley*

> *"Andy Warhol is the only genius I’ve ever known with an IQ of 60."  
-- Gore Vidal*

> *"Genious is man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"If a man knows more than others he becomes lonely."  
-- Carl Jung*

> *"Those who are able to see beyond the shadows and lies of their culture will never be understood let alone believed by the masses."  
-- Plato*

> *"Tolerance will reach such a level that intelligent people will be banned from thinking so as not to offend the imbeciles."  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

## On wealth

<!--
> *"Beware of overconcern for money, or position, or glory. Someday you will meet a man who cares for none of these things. Then you will know how poor you are."  
-- Rudyard Kipling*

- an unhurried sense of time is in itself a form of wealth.
-->

> *"To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy." (...)  
"No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Being rich is being fulfilled.

> *"You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness."  
-- Mr. Money Mustache*

> *"Some people are so poor, all they have is money."  
-- Patrick Meagher*

> *"Being rich is having money; being wealthy is having time."  
-- Stephen Swidr*

> *"Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more."  
-- Seneca*

### On money

<!--
- dinheiro dá liberdade | o poder é o impacto q tens na vida das pessoas
-->

Money is trust. A system of mutual trust.

Money is a tool; it can be a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams. However, the perpetual pursuit of more is not the path to happiness. Money doesn’t purchase happiness; it buys freedom.

> *"A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"We don’t make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies."  
-- Walt Disney*

> *"It’s nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don’t want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it’s a little like saving sex for your old age."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money."  
-- Voltaire*

> *"After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts."  
-- Aristotle Onassis*

### How to get wealthy (without getting lucky)

> *"You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money; you get rich by saving your time to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Rich people stay rich by living like they’re broke. Broke people stay broke by living like they’re rich."  
-- Proverb*

Making money is not about luck. 

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
- Equip yourself with specialized knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specialized knowledge is what you learn uniquely, not through standard education. If society can teach it to you, it can teach it to others, making you replaceable. You acquire specialized knowledge by following your genuine interests, not just current trends. While you might find it enjoyable, others may see it as hard work. This kind of knowledge is usually passed on through apprenticeships, not traditional schooling. It often involves technical or creative expertise that’s difficult to outsource or automate.  
- Embrace responsability and take business risks under your own name. In exchange, society might grant you more duties, ownership, and influence. The most accountable people usually have unique, public, and bold personal brands, like Oprah, Trump, Kanye, and Elon. 
- Select partners with intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Stay away from cynics and pessimists, as their negative beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
- To become wealthy, offer what society wants but can’t access easily, and do it at a large scale. Pick an industry for long-term projects with similar-minded people. The internet has opened up diverse career options, yet many haven’t realized this. Focus on persistent efforts. In life, the most substantial gains come from building on past progress. Money is a tool for trading experiences. Create valuable experiences to build your wealth. 
- Prioritize building wealth instead of chasing money or status. Wealth involves owning assets that generate income without constant effort. Understand that it’s possible to create wealth ethically. Don’t pay attention to those who focus on status games; they often gain status by criticizing wealth builders. Money is a sensitive topic as many tie their self-worth and identity to their jobs and earnings, reflecting their skills and competence in the market.  
- You won’t achieve significant wealth by simply trading your time for money. To attain financial freedom, you must have ownership or equity in a business or venture.
- When you eventually attain wealth, you will realize that it wasn’t your primary pursuit in the first place.

> *"You spend the first 20 years of being rich accumulating all of this stuff. And then you’ll spend the next 20 years trying to get out of one thing after another to simplify your life."  
-- Peter Mallouk*

> *"To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Money follows execution, not precedes it." (...)  
"Making money is not something that you do - it’s a skill that you learn." (...)   
"Management is the oldest, and most over-rated form of leverage. Capital, media, and code are the modern forms."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On free wealth

Books, friends, sleep, ideas, questions, gratefulness, laugh.






---
## On popularity

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."  
-- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.

> *"If you’re not ready to be hated, you’re not ready to be famous." (...)  
"The reward for getting on the stage is fame. The price of fame is that you can’t get off stage." (...)  
"You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Brand is just a perception, and perception will match reality over time. Sometimes it will be ahead, other times it will be behind. But brand is simply a collective impression some have about a product."  
-- Elon Musk*

> *"He who is known as an early riser need not get up until noon."  
-- Proverb*






---
## On luck and risk

<!--
> *"We all have enough strength to endure the misfortunes of other people."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld*
> *"I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi."  
-- M. Vázquez Montalban*
> *"Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day."  
-- Paulo Coelho*
> *"When I think I'm unfairly hated, I try to remember that I'm unfairly loved."  
-- R.C. Sproul*
> *"Opportunity is missed by most of people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work."  
-- Thomas Edison*

-->

> *"Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve."  
-- Charlie Munger*

Unless you’re winning, life will seem unfair to you.

Bad luck is often bad planning. If you’re sure it’s not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually. «Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge. «Surprises» only happen when they didn’t repeat on one’s lifetime. Everything is a pattern.

> *"Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The devil always takes back his gifts."  
-- Proverb*

> *"Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous." (...)  
"God is subtle but he is not malicious."  
-- Albert Einstein*

### On risk and chance

> *"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."  
-- Seneca*

Risk is everything you left over and didn’t thought about.

	RISK = THREATS x VULNERABILITIES

 Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. The best things in life are born from coincidence. Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier. Luck and risk are two faces of the same coin.

> *"Things that come with little help of luck are more resistant to randomness."  
-- Nassim Taleb*

> *"What do I want to know about investing that we can’t know? The exact role of luck in successful outcomes."  
-- Robert Schiller*

> *"Risk is what's left over when you think you've thought of everything."  
-- Carl Richards*

> *"The day you decide to do it is your lucky day."  
-- Proverb*

### On hope

> *"Hope is the bread of the poor."  
-- Proverb*






---
## On beauty and style

<!--
- dress like you’re going somewhere better later
- taste may be an instinct for honest signals
-->

> *"If cats looked like frogs we’d realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember."  
-- Terry Pratchett*

A beautiful person always see beauty in others. Beauty grabs attention. Personality grabs the heart.

> *"A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman."  
-- Coco Chanel*

> *"Beauty needs a witness. This the only thing a man ever needs to know."  
-- Zan Perrion*

> *"Elegance is a physical quality. If a woman doesn’t have it naked, she’ll never have it clothed."  
-- Karl Lagerfeld*

> *"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"The only thing more mysteriously attractive than beauty is corruption."  
-- Octave Mirbeau*

> *"Many complain of their looks but none of their brains."  
-- Proverb*






---
## On health

<!--
> *"The secret to living well and longer is: eat half, walk double, laugh triple and love without measure."  
-- Proverb*
-->

> *"You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness."  
-- Allen Tucker*

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

### How to stay healthy?

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.  
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting.  
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated.

> *"The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison."  
-- Ann Wigmore*

> *"You can eat any dessert you want if you take only 3 bites."  
-- Kevin Kelly*






---
## On lifestyle

> *"I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life."  
-- David Hockney*

We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die. When life becomes about enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

> *"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."  
-- Robert Heinlein*

> *"Each of us, when our day’s work is done, must seek our ideal, whether it be love or pinochle or lobster à la Newburg, or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves."  
-- O. Henry*

> *"Spend extravagantly on the things that you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t."  
-- Ramit Sethi*

> *"Time you enjoy wasting, was not wasted."  
-- Bertrand Russell*

> *"Any idiot can face a crisis; it's this day-to-day living that wears you out."  
-- Anton Chekhov*

> *"Mondays are fine. It's your life that sucks."  
-- Ricky Gervais*

> *"What does the money machine eat? It eats youth, spontaneity, life, beauty, and, above all, it eats creativity. It eats quality and shits quantity."  
-- William S. Burroughs*

> *"If you have a garden and a library, you have everything you need."  
-- Cicero*

> *"The happiest of all lives is a busy solitude."  
-- Voltaire*

<!--
> *"Solitude is for me a fount of healing which makes my life worth living. Talking is often a torment for me, and I need many days of silence to recover from teh futility of words."  
-- Carl Jung*
> *"Don't be seduced into thinking that that which does not make a profit is without value."  
-- Arthur Miller*

- create a life you don't need a vacation from
- never before has a generation so diligently recorded themselves accomplishing so little.
- some people want a big house, a fast car and lots of money. some people want a tiny cabin in the woods away from those kinds of people.
- what’s your adrenaline type? velocidade ou fronteira do conhecido
- If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?
- I do not believe making money in order to consume goods is mankinds's sole purpose on this planet.
-->

Hints:

- Build a business with the heuristic of «maximize my vacation time». You will often be presented with two options: the lucrative option and the lifestyle option. Don’t play the government’s game.
- Aspire to work 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.  
- Aspire to move past room-mates, commutes, alarm clocks and calendars. (Naval Ravikant)
- Own my house on a few acres with clean water river frontage, and assets I can enjoy & be creative with (car, bike, music equipment, tools, etc)  
- How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life? Geoarbitrage. Car: max 10K. Job: live next to it. Income doesn’t make you rich. spending habits do.  
- The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression.  
- 3 hobbies: one creative, one to keep in shape and one to make money.
- House + work + third place. We drink to loosen our tongues. Feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.  
- I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.  
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

> *"At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3." (...)  
"For a great payoff, be especially curious about the things you are not interested in."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Hard work is simply the refuge of people that have nothing to do." (...)  
"We live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Think of each day as a single life."  
-- Seneca*

> *"He who buys what he does not need, steals from himself." (...)  
"Joy and sorrow sleep on the same bed."  
-- Proverbs*

> *"To measure your quality of life, simply do nothing and see how it feels." (...)  
"People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom." (...)  
"When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people more happy than you." (...)  
"No routine. I’m famously unscheduled." (...)  
"You should be too busy to do coffee, while still keeping an uncluttered calendar." (...)  
"Develop strategic incompetence - people won’t ask you to do things you hate to do if you’re bad at them."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On travel

> *"Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain."  
-- Jack Kerouac*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.  
- For how long? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days of travel. Frequency beats intensity. 
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with “lifers”: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

> *"What gives value to travel is fear."  
-- Albert Camus*

> *"A vacation + a disaster = an adventure."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"A vacation is a very expensive way to schedule the time to read a book in peace."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On clutter

> *"Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination."  
-- Christina Scalise*

Hints:

- Remove unnecessary distractions and obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals. Technology is my slave, not my master. I’m not choosing ignorance. I’m choosing to not watch wrestling.  
- Minimalism doesn’t avoid possession. Only excess. The less you own, the less owns you. Owning less is better than organizing more. Eliminate instead of organizing. All that clutter used to be money. Organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling. Actively declutter makes room for your true treasures and clarify your values. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need. if you don’t love it or use it is clutter. Decluttering is self-care. Clutter is not just physical stuff. It’s old ideas, toxic relationships and bad habits. Clutter is everything that doesn’t support the better self. Storage is a way of warehousing the past.
- Use it or loose it. A tool is useful when passes human level. Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.  
- Buy supplies before you need them. Gadgets after you need them. Three is two. Two is one. One is none.
- You can never be over dressed or over educated but avoid clothing that are more interesting than you are.

> *"I went to collect the few personal belongings which I held to be invaluable: my cat, my resolve to travel, and my solitude."  
-- Colette*

> *"Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"If a little is not enough for you, nothing is."  
-- Epicurus*

### On vice

-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"When a person can't find a deep sense of meaning, they distract themselves with pleasure."  
-- Viktor Frankl*

## On success

<!--
> *"Success lies in relentless execution of the basics."  
-- Leonardo da Vinci*
> *"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, there are consequences."  
-- Robert G. Ingersoll*
> *"Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm."  
-- Winston Churchill*

- the true measure of success is a calm nervous system.
- success is a collection of well curated failures.
- the most successful people are those who are good at plan b.
-->

> *"Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it."  
-- Marva Collins*

	SUCCESS = EDUCATION + ACTION

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period. Succeeding means securing advantage.

Success (and happiness) is internal not external. True fulfillment comes from living not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material. When people finally became a «success» they realize that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100K in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them.
