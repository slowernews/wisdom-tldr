- Enter action with boldness. Play the ball before it plays you. Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.
- If something compounds at 1% a day, it will be 37 times better in a year. If something loses 1% a day, it will be 0.03% of what it was in a year. I know it’s hard to quantify. It’s impossible. But the direction is what is important. It will all shake out in the end. This is the path to improvement any area of life.

- The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were: Start with the answer first. Group and summarize your supporting arguments. Logically order your supporting ideas. Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”

- The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present _exactly_3 reasons: Your argument gets their attention and is memorable. You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons. You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.

## On speed and direction

<!--

-->

> *"Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction."  
-- Joel Barker [1945]*

Direction is more important than velocity. Even if we can’t choose the starting point, often, we can choose the direction.

When possible, position yourself for victory by bringing the target closer. Location is better than space amount so trade space for time.

First the essential. Then the details.

Focusing is an art. Time itself is not your limitation: attention is. Busy imply out of control. Lack of time is lack of priorities.

- Always look where you want to go, not where you don’t want to go.

-->

> *"As few as you can, as many as you must."  
-- John Stuart Mill [1806]*

Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity, it’s stupidity.

Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. Productivity is about attention management. Do less to achieve more. You don’t need to optimise everything. 20% of your effort will give you 80% of output and it may be more than enough. 

Hints:

- Protect your time like your money. Protect your hours of real work. Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Focus on one to three outcomes per day (include one important but not urgent task) and tackle the most important one in the morning. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place.
- 80/20 is fractal: If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value, 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value. So 4% of the work you do may create 64% of the benefits!
- Ruthless cut all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Always work with a specific purpose in mind. Set specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goals.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish report” might turn into “write report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- Learn to focus and being fully present on what you are doing now.
- Work by layers: from functional to excellency.
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk.
- When a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it.
- Buy yourself time: delegate. Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- To get anything done quickly, ask a busy person to do it.

## On luck and risk

<!--
> *"I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi."  -- M. Vázquez Montalban*
-->

> *"If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

Unless you’re winning, life will seem unfair to you.

Bad luck is often bad planning. If you’re sure it’s not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually. «Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge. «Surprises» only happen when they didn’t repeat on one’s lifetime. Everything is a pattern.

Risk is everything you left over and didn’t thought about.

	RISK = THREATS x VULNERABILITIES

### On chance

> *"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. The best things in life are born from coincidence. Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

## On control

<!--
> *"They say Trump is out of control, but he’s not. He’s just out of their control."  -- Tucker Carlson*
+ x@skylarromines -- Never correct anyone who’s wrong unless you’re being paid to do it. Watch quality of life improve.

- Não se pode fazer colecção de tudo.
- focus on what doesnt change

- we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe. 
-->

> *"You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink."  
-- vox populi*

Disorder is not a mistake; it’s our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

Control what you can: what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on. Ignore the rest.

Consuming information gives the control freak an illusion of control. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that the universe doesn’t make sense and he doesn’t trust himself to handle disorder in a situation that will get out of his league or skillset.

> *"Sometimes people don’t want to hear the truth because they don’t want their illusions destroyed."

-- John C. Lilly [1915]*

> *"Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security there is."

## On balance

<!--
- alguem mais loose q tu é um maluco, mais tight é um nhónhó. somos a medida de tudo
-->

> *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

Life is a balancing act. Most things are not binary.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite. The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *"Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"The optimal zone for performance is «slightly hungry»." (...)  
"Don’t settle and don’t struggle. Life is what flows in between." (...)  
"You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you can’t wait for consensus."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It’s about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships and personal growth.

Hints:

- Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.
- There are two approaches to improving yourself: 1) The self-improvement junkie. 2) The self-improvement tourists. (Mark Manson)

> *"Where there is too much, something is missing." (...)  
"Sunshine all the time makes a desert."   
-- vox populi*

> *"Life is a balance between holding on and letting go."  
-- Rumi [1207]*

> *"You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough."  
-- William Blake [1757]*

### How to balance an imbalance?

Overcompensate. Some people get passion from something they struggled with.

### How to change?

> *"It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

There are limits on change. Willpower is finite and change requires attention. However, small changes in a complex system can cause large changes.

### On getting advantage

<!--
> *"The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history."  -- George Orwell [1903]*
+ x@paulskallas -- Asymmetries reward those who see them first. They’re invisible rules that control your life. Most people never see them. But once you learn to spot these hidden imbalances, in your salary, your relationships, your career, you gain an unfair advantage.

- Changing the subject. Hallmark of the loser
- applying force vs removing obstacles. when you apply force you can identify obstacles. -- x@codie_sanchez*
- failing causes: group decisions / decide based on how sucessful others are deciding / asymetry of risk-reward / overdiversificaton / inertia
- What works at a small scale (say, a Utopian community), loses its effectiveness as it scales. Everything has a breakpoint. Their cheating had a small individual effect initially, so it went unnoticed. But the follow-on effect to individual cheating is group cheating, and the utopian goal of To each according to his need, from each according to his ability had the effect of expanding everyone’s needs and shrinking their ability, aided by envy and reciprocation effects.
- What’s your advantage: informational, analytical, or behavioral?	
- You must play by your rules, funnel your weird stuff to give you some advantage.
-->

> *"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."  
-- Napoleon Bonaparte [1769]*

Strategy is about winning before the battle begins, tactics are about striking at weakness.

Leverage is a force multiplier. Leverage your target weaknesses to raise your chances of winning. Use methods like unpredictability, charming or mirroring. Even deceiving, some opponents may require special tools.

> *"Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth."  
-- Archimedes [-212]*

> *"The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed."  
-- Richard Rumelt [1942]*

> *"You are strong only where you were broken." (...)  
"It’s hard to defeat a high-morale defender with an unlimited supply line." (...)  
"Leverage converts knowledge into power." (...)  
"Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
An army of robots is freely available - it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Hints:

- If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.
- Divide and conquer.
- Beware of counter-attacking: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.
- Any change require injecting more energy than is extracted by the system.
- Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.
- Drain opponent morale with unexpected defeat or unexpected strong defence.
- Every strenght has a complementary weakness.
- Look to people when they are bluffing.

### On charming

<!--
> *"You will never fully convince someone that he is wrong; only reality can."  -- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

- Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex, habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.
- Never trust a person who hangs out with the same people that they talk bad about.
- People only get defensive if what you’re saying about them is true.
- the best way to get someone’s attention is to stop giving them yours.
- the good reason and the real reason.
- When someone can’t use logic to make you care about the same things they care about, they resort to name-calling: sociopath, soulless, etc. But recall: misplaced empathy is why the west is falling. -- Diane Yap
-->

> *"To combat an adversary, become their friend."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Charm the enemy to find their weaknesses. Then exploit them.

Hints:

- People’s need for validation and recognition, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. To persuade up, focus on interests; to persuade down focus on emotions.
- Use absence and bait to attract people. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections. The ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression. use it with moderation.
- Instead of killing it, charm the snake to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. First they have to trust you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy has always to prove himself.

-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear."  
-- Hannah Arendt [1906]*

If we play by the rules too strictly, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish. Fair players on shady markets usually don’t do well on the short term.

By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you. However deceiving is not lying. Lying is like a nuclear bomb, the effects will be there for a long time. Disappointment destroys trust.

> *"Poker is about maximizing deceptiveness while extracting information from your opponent."  
-- x@liv_boeree*

Hints:

- It’s hard to cheat an honest opponent.
- Don’t attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness. So never be mean to anybody that can hurt you by doing nothing.
- The only time you enjoy hearing a lie is when you already know the truth.
- The only thing worth praying is truth.
- If you are in a subordinate position, unpredictability reduces trust.
- Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.
- There are 2 rules in life. Number one: never give out all the information.

### On mirroring

<!--
"Start by being warm, pleasant, & generous w/every person you meet; but if someone tries to exercise power over you, exercise power over him; & if he messes w/you, remember to keep messing w/him long after he has forgotten about it".  Silver Rule of Fat Tony in #SkinInTheGame"
-->

> *"Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

Reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation. We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

> *"Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy."

> *"A violent man will die a violent death."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

> *"With a gentleman I try to be a gentleman and a half, and with a fraud I try to be a fraud and a half."

### On defeating status quo

<!--
> *"Growth means change and change involves risk, stepping from the known to the unknown."  -- George Shinn*

-->

> *"To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How? Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate."  
-- Srdja Popovic [1973]*

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

Burocracy prevents low probability events to happen at the expense of making more systems that the other people must comply and that take happiness from them.

> *"If you want to destroy any nation without war, make adultery or nudity common in the young generation."  
-- Saladin [1137]*

> *"Revolutions spring not from accident, but from necessity. A revolution is a return from the factitious to the real. It takes place because it must."

> *"Jokes of the proper kind, properly told, can do more to enlighten questions of politics, philosophy, and literature than any number of dull arguments."  
-- Isaac Asimov [1920]*

> *"A social movement that only moves people is merely a revolt. A movement that changes both people and institutions is a revolution."  
-- Martin Luther King Jr [1929]*

> *"Never argue with someone with the aim of changing his or her mind; focus instead on changing the much less invested minds of the audience."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*






## On finishing

> *"Everything will be ok in the end. If it’s not ok, it’s not the end."  
-- vox populi*

> *"If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start."  
-- Charles Bukowski [1920]*

Starting is fun but success belongs to finishers. Going halfway is a waste. Before you start something, figure out to finish it.

When the end finally comes, it comes quickly. Nothing ends poetically. It ends and we turn it into poetry. All that blood was never once beautiful. It was just red.

> *"Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance." (...)

> *"Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is."  
-- Vince Lombardi [1913]*

It’s not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round. Winning is not the end of the road; it’s just a stop along the way.

Hints:

- Giving yourself permission to lose, automatically guarantees a loss.

### On quiting and surrendering

<!--
- Don’t take it personally, most people who are constantly angry are just sleep-deprived, love-deprived, or purpose-deprived.
- nem todos os problemas se resolvem c o tempo. ha jogos q so se ganha não jogando. guerra decidida pelos velhos e sofrida pelos jovens
- you only get disapointed because you had wrong opinion about someone-something. there’s no finishing line. motinvation is what happens when you’re not afraid. you reject yourself with your explantaion of what happened.

"Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere." (...)  
"You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

Letting go allows progress. Let things happen instead of trying things to happen. Accept loss. Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.

In order to come back you have to go away. Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. If you didn’t quit anything you would be still playing with toddlers. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

### On forgiveness

<!--
- Good kids who do one thing wrong were punished worse than Kids who were always acting up. In fact recently 'good behaviour' from problem kids is rewarded, but nothing for the kids who aren't a problem. Sums up society in a way.
-->

> *"The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive."  
-- John Green [1977]*

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.

Forgiveness is a process of release so the opposite is a decision to hold onto something. By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.

> *"If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn’t part of ourselves doesn’t disturb us."
