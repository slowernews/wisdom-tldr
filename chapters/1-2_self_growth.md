# 1.2 - On growth

## On comfort and risk

<!--
- You think you are playing safe, but you are actually accumulating anxiety. Take bolder risks, it’s mentally liberating.
- If you want to grow as a man... Never stay in the same place for too long.
-->

> *"If you think adventure is dangerous, try routine. It’s lethal."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

You can choose courage or comfort, but you can’t choose both.

Comfort is the enemy of achievement. The size of your life is directly proportional to how much discomfort you are willing to endure. Breaking rules can be frightening and you keep doing what you’re good at to avoid confronting the real problems in your life. You’ll never achieve what you want in life without taking risks. Prioritizing risk over safety is the path to progress. If you act average, you’ll remain average. To outperform, you must be both different and correct. 

Hints:

- Reinvention should be an habit not an event. When you control for one set of risks, another simply arises in its place.
- Repeating close variations on your usual theme unlocks far more value than you’d expect given minimal novelty value is a surprising result.
- Choose the hard way. Life is easy, and a soft life makes for soft people. Take a cold shower, join a boxing gym, use the stairs instead of the escalator, spend a week alone in nature. Being uncomfortable should be «play» for you. Find comfort in discomfort.
- Leap while you’re at the top of the curve, and the next curve builds on the momentum.
- This isn’t just a success strategy; it’s a well-being strategy. The risk of not changing is often greater than the risk of changing.
- Risk looks different for everyone. Stability without stagnation.
- Which do you want - the pain of stayng where you are, or the pain of growth?
- When the love-of-life line crosses the fear-of-death line, all hell breaks loose.

> *"When we are tired, we are attacked by ideas we conquered long ago."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"Normality is a paved road: It’s comfortable to walk, but no flowers grow on it."  
-- Vincent Van Gogh [1853]*

> *"A ship is safe in the harbor but that’s not what ships are for."  
-- John A. Shedd [1859]*

> *"One doesn’t discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore for a very long time."  
-- André Gide [1869]*

> *"The lust for comfort murders the passions of the soul."  
-- Kahlil Gibran [1883]*

> *"Do one thing that scares you everyday."  
-- Eleanor Roosevelt [1884]*

> *"I can’t understand why people are frightened of new ideas. I’m frightened of the old ones."  
-- John Cage [1912]*

> *"If I’d followed all the rules I’d never have gotten anywhere."  
-- Marilyn Monroe [1926]*

-- John C. Maxwell [1947]*

> *"Rather than steering your life to avoid surprises, aim directly for them."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On risk management

> *"Never test the depth of the river with both feet."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Being risk-prone is better than being risk-averse, but don’t allow yourself to be out of the game. Adventure comes from perceived risk, not peril. Develop a tolerance for risk so that you can work up to scarier activities later. The discomfort zone is NOT about experiencing pain.

> *"If your life is free of failures, you’re not taking enough risks."  
-- H. Jackson Brown Jr. [1940]*






## On improving

> *"To improve is to change; to be perfect is to change often."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

Most problems can be solved by graded exposure over time. The accumulation of experience and the analysis of past situations will structure knowledge. 

	PROGRESS = PAIN + REFLECTION

	SKILL = EFFORT * TALENT

Hints:

- Listen to someone explaining challenging techniques, and then attempt to follow their advice. Seek feedback as it accelerates learning.
- If it’s easy and you’re not surprised, you’re not learning. You need to push yourself into the zone of discomfort, where you feel clumsy and face challenges. That’s when real learning occurs.
- Reflect on your mistakes; try to identify the cues you missed and what to look for next time.
- Repeat.

> *"He who asks a question is fool for five minutes. He who does not ask a question remains a fool forever."  
-- vox populi*

> *"It is impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows."

> *"If a man will begin with certainties he shall end in doubts; but if he will be content to begin with doubts he shall end in certainties."  
-- Francis Bacon [1561]*

> *"Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me and I learn."  
-- Benjamin Franklin [1706]*

> *"Every man hears only what he understands."  
-- J.W. Goethe [1749]*

> *"It is not that I’m so smart. But I stay with the questions much longer." (...)

"Once you stop learning, you start dying." (...)

-- Noam Chomsky [1928]*

> *"A lesson taught with humor is a lesson retained."  
-- Ruth Westheimer [1928]*

> *"If you are not failing every now and again, it’s a sign you’re not doing anything very innovative."  
-- Woody Allen [1935]*

> *"In academia there is much talk, little action. In industry, there is much action, little thought."  
-- Donald Norman [1935]*

> *"Pain plus reflection equals progress."  
-- Ray Dalio [1949]*

> *"Learn how to learn from those you disagree with, or even offend you. See if you can find the truth in what they believe." (...)  
"Three things you need: The ability to not give up something till it works, the ability to give up something that does not work, and the trust in other people to help you distinguish between the two." (...)  
"When you are right, you are learning nothing." (...)  
"When you are stuck, sleep on it. Let your subconscious work for you."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"The fastest way to learn is to do things the slow way."  
-- Chris Sommer [1964]*

> *"You should take the approach that you’re wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

### Improving by experience

> *"Tell me and I’ll forget; show me and I may remember; involve me and I’ll understand." (...)  
"If skill could be gained by watching, every dog would become a butcher." (...)  
"Ask the experienced rather than the learned."  
-- vox populi*

> *"I am always doing that which I cannot do, in order that I may learn how to do it."  
-- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

> *"In theory there is no difference between theory and practice; in practice there is"  
-- Yogi Berra [1925]*

> *"The greatest teacher is called «doing»." (...)  
"To make something good, just do it. To make something great, just re-do it, re-do it, re-do it. The secret to making fine things is in remaking them."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"The difference between theory and practice: in theory, there’s no difference between theory and practice; in practice, there is."  
-- Van de Snepscheut [1953]*

> *"What I learned on my own, I still remember."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

### Improving by analysis

> *"Fools say that they learn by experience, I prefer to profit by others’ experience."  
-- Otto von Bismarck [1815]*

Practice makes perfect but doesn’t necessarily bring something new. Innovation comes from having a broader perspective and analyzing past situations. People often repeat the same mistakes. You improve by examining your failures; it will help you let go.

Hints:

- Fastest way to learn is to teach. Write advice to yourself or other people. Review it regularly. Edit it. Refine it. It worked for Marcus Aurelius and it worked for Bruce Lee.
- Journal early before your inhibitions take in. Record the lessons you learn in life. You’ll get more out of life and you’ll make less of the same mistakes. A journal, scotch, and a little music will give you more deep thoughts than you want.

> *"You can only connect the dots looking back, not looking forward."  
-- Steve Jobs [1955]*

### On applied knowledge

<!--
- don’t be so busy preparing for teh future that you never step into it. the satisfaction of binge consumption brings instant gratification, so whty try anything else? the problem with shoving information is the ilusion of knowledge, especially when you rush it.true learning requires comtemplation. And implementation. And a commitment to reflecting on great ideas over and over again.

-->

> *"«Pathological learners» (...) who are voracious consumers of knowledge live in a 400 square foot apartment, are overweight, and in a relationship that looks like a bad soap opera. Yet they know all this information! The problem is that they do not apply it. Knowledge without action is useless."  
-- x@ryanstewman*

Action, not knowledge, leads to success. If you are not consistently applying the new information you’re learning, then it’s merely educational porn.

> *"The purpose of knowledge is action, not knowledge."  
-- Aristotle [-384]*

> *"Seek knowledge. Knowledge and courage are the elements of greatness. Wisdom and strength, eyes and hands. Knowledge without courage is sterile."  
-- Balthasar Gracian [1601]*






## On wisdom

<!--

-->

> *"Wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one’s own advice."  
-- Sam Harris [1967]*

Wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions.  
Wisdom is knowing what to do with what you know.

> *"The measure of intelligence is creativity. The measure of wisdom is sagacity. The measure of ethics is transparency."  
-- x@rapahelz*

### On mastery

<!--
- There’s always room for improvement; be humble. There is no place for a «prima donna». If you’re not improving today, you’re regressing. Skills are perishable, and the path to mastery is a never-ending story. Some of the skills you need to achieve expertise have not yet been systematized.
-->

> *"An expert is a person who has made all the mistakes which can be made in a very narrow field."  
-- Niels Bohr [1885]*

True experts recognize the limits of what they know and what they do not know.

-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Masters are able to ask the kinds of simple questions that most people pass over."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"A real DJ has to know how to clear the floor. To know the worse it can happen and how to come back."  
-- James Altucher [1968]*

> *"You know you’re good at something when you switch from making decisions with your conscious mind to making decisions with your instincts."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Clarity precedes mastery."  
-- Robin Sharma [1965]*

> *"Amateurs play for tricks, masters play for position."

-- x@kunalb11*






## On education

<!--
+ x@shl -- Literacy peaked with Millennials
> *"Every day, with every action and choice, you’re either a teacher and an inspiration, or a lesson and a reminder."*
> *"When you are right, you are learning nothing."*
> *"When you try something new, don’t think of it as a matter of success / failure, but as success / learning to succeed."*

- Young men could learn anything if you questify schools.
- The modern education system doesn’t create leaders. It creates followers. Escape the matrix.
- Young men could learn anything if you questify schools.
- the problem is not, and never have been, "as good as a professional". It has always been "it’s good enoughto replace a professional so it’ll be cheaper." the key thing about AI is that AI+human is waht we’ll do.
- deliberate practice
- He said sniper school is completely mental. Instead of focusing on the negative (don’t flinch), he focused on the positive (keep your eyes on the target.)
- career day an year -> journaling self analysis. skill fluency!
- the next level of your life will demand a different you.

-- Pedro Domingos [1965]*

> *"«I want to have a safety net so I can get a job.» This is what my daughter said to me. Where did she learn the phrase «safety net»? Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult. It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were. It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you. I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears. So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up."

Hints:

- Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory and persuasion.
- Believe in principles. The basics are really important, not jargon or specifics. Understand it, not memorize it. You only need to understand a few basic concepts. complexity emerges from very simple rules.
- Applied focus. This means that while you should only strive for mastery in a small handful of skills, you should seek to be competent in a wide variety of disciplines. Don’t major on minor things.
- School fails in subjects like: how to build self confidence / how to be good with money / dating and relationships skills / confrontation skills / critical thinking / creative productivity.
- Education leads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward a final self-definition.
- School rewards generalists, the world not so.
- School’s real study topic is obedience. No one is going to give you the education you need to overthrow them.
- Success is the worst teacher.
- The biggest mistake anyone makes when studying a foreign language is that they do it little by little, not jumping into it head first. Language is not mathematics; one doen’t need to learn it, one needs to get accustomed to it. It’s not about logic or memory; It’s about experience and skill.

> *"The strongest intellectual foundation is built upon science, math and philosophy, as they are the search for universal truths." (...)  
"Study math to understand physics. Study physics to understand chemistry. Study chemistry to understand biology. Study biology to understand psychology. Study psychology to understand economics. Study economics and philosophy to be free." (...)  
"Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory, and persuasion." (...)  
"Timeless: science, math, philosophy, rhetoric. First principles. Creating art & business. Family & lifelong friends. Habits to calm mind & body. Temporary: politics, news, estertainment. Memorizing facts. Hourly work. Transactional relationships. Drugs & doctors for mind and body." (...)  
"The ideal school would teach health, wealth and happiness. It would be self-paced and available to all. It would show opposing ideas and students would self-verify truth. No grades, no tests, no diplomas - just learning. Actually you’re already here. Careful who you follow."

## On reading

<!--
- Barbell approach: consume what’s latest and the oldest books. Most of modern bookstores sell the middle.
-->

> *"I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

Reading trains your model of the world. Even if you forget most, its effect persists.

> *"Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren’t very new after all."  
-- Abraham Lincoln [1809]*

> *"One cannot read a book: one can only reread it. A good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a rereader."  
-- Vladimir Nabokov [1899]*

> *"A book is less important for what it says than for what it makes you think."  
-- Louis L’amour [1908]*

### On classics

> *"The great books are the books that never have to be written again."  
-- Carl Van Doren [1885]*

Don’t read the books made to make money, read the ones they want to ban. Most books are propaganda.

If you want better ideas, read better books. If you want new ideas, read old books.

> *"The worst thing about new books is that they keep us from reading the old ones."  
-- Joseph Joubert [1754]*

> *"A classic is a book which people praise and don’t read."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"I don’t believe in book recommendations lol. Reading what everyone else is already reading—especially books has minimal value (hardly a novel observation) therefore you should allocate your time differently. If everyone’s reading it, the insights are already absorbed into the zeitgeist or regurgitated online. Reading what’s obscure gives you asymmetric knowledge—potentially valuable ideas others haven’t yet mined. There’s a counter: sometimes it pays to understand why a popular book resonates. It’s less about the book itself & more about mapping the cultural moment or the biases of the masses. For this use case I just use chatgpt."

## On writing

<!--
+ x@g_s_bhogal -- You'll never know most of your beliefs, because you’ll never express them. To discover who you are, write.

5. I wrote down the funny stuff I overheard. I learned to be like a ship’s rat, veined ears trembling, and i learned to scribble it all down.
9. good writing is about telling the truth. we are species that needs and wants to understand who we are.
13. become a better writer is going to help you become a better reader, and that is the real payoff.
15. e.l.doctorow once said that: "writing a novel is like driving a car at night. you can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the hole trip that way."
45. when people shine a little light on their monster, we find out how similar most of our monsters are.
46. we write to expose the unexposed. If there’s one door in teh castle you have been told not to go through, you must. Otherwise, you’ll just be rearranging furniture in rooms you’ve already been in.
47. Annie Dillard has said that day by day you have to give the work before you all teh best stuff you have, not saving up for later projects. If you give freely, there will always be more.
49. becoming a writer is about becoming conscious.
50. you can either set a brick as a laborer or as an artist.

It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important. So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music"

### On email

Hints:

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS. 






## On habits and systems

> *"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit."  
-- Will Durant [1885]*

Habits are systems. We are essentially our habits. Habits are like compound interest in real life.

Consistency doesn’t result from effort, it comes from showing up. Long-term thinking and discipline will guarantee you an easier life. Endurance is more relevant than toughness.

Hints:

- See your life as a series of “hotspots.” Every day you invest your time, energy, and attention into seven hotspots: mind, body, emotions, career, finances, relationships, and fun. See your hotspots as a portfolio to make sure you don’t overinvest in some areas and underinvest in others. Annual review: GOOD + BAD.
- You do not raise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.
- Stop a bad behaviour by filling the space with a better one. Replacement is better than abstinence.

> *"People don’t decide their future, they decide their habits and their habits decide their futures."  
-- F.M. Alexander [1869]*

> *"Continuous effort, not strength or intelligence, is the key to unlocking our potential."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"First we make our habits, then our habits make us."  
-- (major general) Charles C. Noble [1916]*

> *"Chains of habit are too light to be felt until they are to heavy to be broken."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"You'll never change your life until you change something you do daily. The secret to your success is found in your daily routine."  
-- John C. Maxwell [1947]*

> *"The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"At any given time, I’m either trying to pick up a good habit or discard a previous bad habit." (...)  
"It isn’t 10k hours that creates outliers, it’s 10k iterations." (...)  
"I probably read 1-2 hours a day, and that puts me in the top 0,00001%."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to change habits?

> *"Willpower isn’t just a skill. It’s a muscle, like the muscles in your arms or legs, and it gets tired as it works harder, so there’s less power left over for other things."  
-- Charles Duhigg [1974]*

We tend to abandon the good system we’ll follow in search of the perfect system that we will quit.

Hints:

- Try to break a bad habit and form a good one every 6 months.
- Avoid low-leverage habits: news (unnecessary stress and negative bias), pointless notifications, social media (use it for output, not entertainment; other people’s stories are more interesting when you don’t know what’s going on), smartphones (should not be the first thing you see in the morning or the last thing at night), owning a TV, overworking, unhealthy relationships, judgment, micromanagement, perfectionism, virtue signaling.
- Cultivate high-leverage habits: develop useful skills, exercise, rest, meditate, travel, read, journal, enjoy music, create, network, make friends, spend time outdoors with friends and family, indulge in massages, practice gratitude, forgive, prioritize self-awareness, plan, eat mindfully, focus, do less, prioritize sleep and naps, smile, and embrace colors.
- Small steps are more likely to lead to success. For example, if you find resistance to meditating for 15 minutes, try starting with just five minutes.
- Anticipate obstacles to new habits.
- Get accountable by making an agreement with someone that includes financial penalties for habits that are bad for you.
- Reward yourself to reinforce new habits.
- Pay attention, correct your course and don’t judge. Don’t strive for perfection. Having a few vices makes life more interesting.
