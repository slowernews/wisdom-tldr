# 2.2 - On competition

## On hierarchy

<!--
> *"If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame.*

- How he carries himself is how he will be treated. A man with supreme confidence and self-assurance will be treated like one.
- if you don’t like something, just take away its only power: your attention.
- in any hierarchy there are zealots
- No one cares about you until you win. No one is ever ignoring you, everyone is focused on their goals, and you should be doing the same.
- People don’t fly business class just for the seat. They do it to not have to spend 12 hours with normies. The more money you make the more you realize the barriers to luxury are not just for comfort. But for seperation.
- People like to feel in control. if we try them to get them do something, people feel disempowered. if they feel that somebody is deciding for them they say no when they would be happy to go along.
- people respect who they can’t disrespect. 
- Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren’t random or stupid.

> *"If you want to know who controls you, look at who you are not allowed to criticize." (...)  
"It is dangerous to be right in matters where established men are wrong."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

Everything is hierarchy. Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

However don’t vow to the gatekeepers. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It’s a business relationship.

## On opponents and allies

<!--
> *"Só os mais corajosos conseguem fazer a paz."  -- Trump*

- Be willing to side with the minority.
- Find cassandras to stop catastrophes. The “Cassandras” are experts in their field. These people are data driven.
- i fear not the man who’s read ten thousand books, but the man who’s read the book ten thousand times.
- Nietszche says to measure one’s strength by the number of parasites one can support.
- surpass a gatekeeper: i’m x, i know your situation and how is the way i can make it the most confortable (safe) for you.
- The wicked don’t listen. When you shame a good man for a small infraction, he feels guilty. He tries to do better. When you shame a genuinely bad man, he doesn’t care. He views you with contempt because you do. Shaming the incorrigible is futile. Pointless.
- understand the difference of an adversary and an enemy to not accumulate enemys.
- When narratives begin to shift and the once good guys are labelled as bad it’s not surprising they fight back. They’ll point to criticisms as exaggerations. Their faults as misunderstandings.
- your competition isn’t other people. Your competition is your proscrastination. Your ego. The unhealthy food you’re consuming, the knowledge you neglect. The negative behaviour you’re nurturing & your lack of creativity. Compete against that.

-- J.W. Goethe [1749]*

Beware of all players.

People are amazing optimizers and will find any loopholes or gaps to their advantage. Only your parents will help you in a way that is prejudicial to them.

### On easy opponents

Easy players are often just deceiving you. However - if you can identify them - there are people acting stupid that are easy wins.

### On desperate opponents

> *"Necessity knows no law." (...)  
"Fear can make a donkey attack a lion."  
-- vox populi*

Beware of sad people.

Desperate players will risk everything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *"Don’t fight a starving animal. Never contend with a man who has nothing to Lose; for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict. The other enters without anxiety; having lost everything, including shame, he has no further loss to fear. He therefore re-sorts to all kinds of insolence."  
-- Balthasar Gracian [1601]*

> *"Beware the fury of a patient man."  
-- John Dryden [1631]*

### On difficult opponents

The thougest competition is a good enough competitor.

Besides outworking them, you’ll need all weaponry. Sometimes even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff». They may be effective but use them only on desperate situations: it’s a scar for life.

## On envy triggers

### On talent

<!--
- You discover your true intelligence once you start acting instead of overthinking.
- IQ is like speed of running. If you run in a wrong direction, it will not help you.
-->

> *"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction."  
-- Ernst F. Schumacher [1911]*

To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays. Talent is fragile and it’s the most sensitive envy trigger.

Intelligence is a spectrum, your dog is intelligent also.

> *"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination." (...)  
"The measure of intelligence is the ability to change."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."  
-- Isaac Asimov [1920]*

> *"I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that’s not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile."  
-- Malcolm Gladwell [1963]*

> *"Intelligence is curiosity. It is that and only that. If you are curious, you are intelligent. If you are not curious, you are not intelligent. In fact, politically correct be damned, I will say it straight: A general lack of curiosity is a general lack of intelligence. I will even go so far as to say that a general lack of curiosity is the worst of all traits." (...)  
"Curiosity is a form of creation."  
-- Zan Perrion [1964]*

> *"The difference between sounding smart and being smart is «I don’t know»." (...)  
"The real test of intelligence is if you get what you want from life."

#### On geniality

### On wealth

<!--
- Money loves speed. Wealth loves time. Poverty loves indecision.
- Wealth is the slave of the wise man and master of the fool.
- «I made my millions by brewing my own coffee at home.» -- Said no one ever. If you want to achieve wealth: you need to create, not save.
- people don't get rich because of intelligence. Most people who get rich in business are usually insanely self-disciplined. Self-discipline is the real metric for succes
-->

> *"To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy." (...)  
"No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Being rich is being fulfilled. An unhurried sense of time is in itself a form of wealth.

> *"Contentment is natural wealth; luxury is artificial poverty."  
-- Socrates [-470]*

> *"Self-sufficiency is the greatest of all wealth."  
-- Epicurus [-341]*

> *"Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

#### On money

<!--
- Never worship money, but always avoid people who hate money. They hate competence. They have a distorted view of reality. They are losers. Never associate with losers... or you’ll become one.
-->

> *"We don’t make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies."  
-- Walt Disney [1901]*

Money is a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams. However, the perpetual pursuit of more is not the path to happiness. Money doesn’t purchase happiness; it buys freedom.

> *"Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts."  
-- Aristotle Onassis [1906]*

> *"A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

#### How to get wealthy without luck

<!--
- I don’t waste time with unpriced listings.
-->

> *"You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money; you get rich by saving your time to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Making money is not about luck. 

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
- Equip yourself with specialized knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specialized knowledge is what you learn uniquely, not through standard education. If society can teach it to you, it can teach it to others, making you replaceable. You acquire specialized knowledge by following your genuine interests, not just current trends. While you might find it enjoyable, others may see it as hard work. This kind of knowledge is usually passed on through apprenticeships, not traditional schooling. It often involves technical or creative expertise that’s difficult to outsource or automate.
- Embrace responsability and take business risks under your own name. In exchange, society might grant you more duties, ownership, and influence. The most accountable people usually have unique, public, and bold personal brands, like Oprah, Trump, Kanye, and Elon.
- Select partners with intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Stay away from cynics and pessimists, as their negative beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
- To become wealthy, offer what society wants but can’t access easily, and do it at a large scale. Pick an industry for long-term projects with similar-minded people. The internet has opened up diverse career options, yet many haven’t realized this. Focus on persistent efforts. In life, the most substantial gains come from building on past progress. Money is a tool for trading experiences. Create valuable experiences to build your wealth.
- Prioritize building wealth instead of chasing money or status. Wealth involves owning assets that generate income without constant effort. Understand that it’s possible to create wealth ethically. Don’t pay attention to those who focus on status games; they often gain status by criticizing wealth builders. Money is a sensitive topic as many tie their self-worth and identity to their jobs and earnings, reflecting their skills and competence in the market. 
- You won’t achieve significant wealth by simply trading your time for money. To attain financial freedom, you must have ownership or equity in a business or venture. You’re spending time to save money when you should be spending money to save time.
- When you eventually attain wealth, you will realize that it wasn’t your primary pursuit in the first place. Free wealth: Books, friends, sleep, ideas, questions, gratefulness, laugh.
- Being broke is hard. Becoming rich is hard. Choose your hard.

> *"He who works all day has no time to make money." (...)  
"I would rather earn 1% off 100 people's efforts than 100% of my own efforts."  
-- John D. Rockefeller [1839]*

> *"The big money is not in the buying and selling, but in the waiting."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

> *"To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Rich people stay rich by living like they’re broke. Broke people stay broke by living like they’re rich."  
-- T. Harv Eker [1954]*

> *"I disagree with the followers of Marx and those of Adam Smith: the reason free markets work is because they allow people to be lucky, thanks to aggressive trial and error, not by giving rewards or «incentives» for skill."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Money follows execution, not precedes it." (...)  
"Making money is not something that you do - it’s a skill that you learn." (...)   
"If you want to be wealthy, spend your time earning, learning, or relaxing. Outsource or ignore everything else." (...)  
"Management is the oldest, and most over-rated form of leverage. Capital, media, and code are the modern forms." (...)  
"Asymmetric opportunities: invest in startups. Start a company. Create a book, podcast, video. Create a (software) product. Go on many first dates. Go to a cocktail party. Read a Lindy book. Move to a big city. Buy bitcoin. Tweet." (...)  
"Much of investing is avoiding FOMO buying and panic selling." (...)  
"It doesn’t take money to make money, it takes leverage to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

"Where there’s value, there’s money."  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

#### On money management

<!--
- Salary is for expenses. Equity is wealth. Invest in yourself and stop renting your time. Be an owner.
- It’s crazy to think the entire real estate market is propped up by what is essentially the entire middle class being 100x long.
- inflation = printing money.
- Stock buybacks are effectively same as dividends.
- entrepreneurship vs investment - 2 different mentalities.
- auctions ao contrario! vendo por 40mil. o q venderes dai para cima 50% é para ti!
- analise fundamental e técnica no poker como nas accoes. Crashes are typical of complex systems.
- why do you want to invest? to make excitement or to make money?
-->

> *"I succeeded because I have a long attention span. (...)  
"Waiting helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can’t stand to wait."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

The secret of healthy finances is not to make more money but to keep some.

Hints:

- Diversify with uncorrelated investment bets (barbell strategy).
- Spend less than you make. Saving 10% of all paychecks is a good start. Keep some liquidity, avoid investing in anything you can’t sell in a month or two.
- Modern slaves are not chains, they are debt. Ultimately is about the total cost of the mortgage. That is the price of the home. The closing price is an illusion. Today, people with moderate incomes, are forced to speculate or live in poverty.

"Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1." (...)  
"It’s nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don’t want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it’s a little like saving sex for your old age."

"The two biggest investing mistakes are panic buying and panic selling." (...)

"I only believe in micro. I don’t believe in macro." (...)  
"All returns in life, weather in wealth, relationships or knowledge come from compound interest." (...)  
"A great reason to buy instead of renting is that you get to fire your landlord."  
"Understanding economics means continually asking, «But at what cost?»" (...)  
"Every generation has to learn the lesson of inflation firsthand." (...)  
"Diversification is a hedge against a lack of knowledge." (...)

### On investment comfort zone

> *"When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Scared money never wins. It’s all about the risk of losing money versus the risk of missing opportunity. 

> *"The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket."  
-- Kin Hubbard [1868]*

> *"I’m not interested in anything that’s not sustainable. Friendships, investing, careers, podcasts, reading habits, exercise habits. If I can’t keep it going, I’m not interested in it."  
-- x@morganhousel*

#### How to spot good investments?

> *"It’s not what you buy. It’s what you pay. There is no asset which is so good that it can’t be overpriced and very few assets which are so bad that they can’t be underpriced. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism."  
-- Howard Marks [1946]*

What’s my religion? Arbitrage and rents.

Hints:

- What’s going to stay the same in the next ten years. While boring, offer the best investment opportunities.
- Where is low optimism. Recessions are caused when a bunch of people lose confidence all at once.
- Know who are the buyers, the sellers and their motivations.
- Investments are competing with each other.
- The best companies aren’t sold, they’re bought. Stay away from junk stocks.
- The more you know, the less you need to diversify. Diversification is an hedge against lack of knowledge.
- Take risk from the table whenever possible.
- Don’t buy on future hopes, buy on past mistakes. We don’t loose money on star businesses, we loose money on businesses we think will be star businesses.
- Good investors don’t sell investment advice and not talk about their returns.

### On popularity

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."  
-- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.
Don’t strive to be well-known, strive to be worth knowing.

- I much prefer the riches I had - anonymity, freedom, simplicity - to those they have today - technology driven constant connectedness, ultra convenient (but awful) food, instant entertainment. It’s the difference between a vigorous independent youth and one scheduled and managed by the predominant culture. I prefer the former.
- If you’re from a poor background, entertainment is your enemy. That sh!t will keep you poor.
- some people want a big house, a fast car and lots of money. some people want a tiny cabin in the woods away from those kinds of people.

> *"I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life."  
-- David Hockney [1937]*

It’s okay to live a life others don’t understand. 

We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die. When life becomes about enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

Hints:

- Build a business with the heuristic of «maximize my vacation time». You will often be presented with two options: the lucrative option and the lifestyle option. 
- Aspire to work 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.
- Aspire to move past room-mates, commutes, alarm clocks and calendars. (Naval Ravikant)
- Own my house on a few acres with clean water river frontage, and assets I can enjoy & be creative with (car, bike, music equipment, tools, etc)  
- How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life? Geoarbitrage. Car: max 10K. Job: live next to it. Income doesn’t make you rich. spending habits do.
- The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression. Create a life you don’t need a vacation from. Making money in order to consume goods can’t mankinds’s sole purpose on this planet.
- 3 hobbies: one creative, one to keep in shape and one to make money.
- House + work + third place. We drink to loosen our tongues. Feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
- I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.
- You can never be over dressed or over educated but avoid clothing that are more interesting than you are.
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
- You don’t have to be rich to start living the life you want. Most people were just brainwashed into thinking that they wanted a luxurious, expensive lifestyle. A happy life tends to be much simpler: a healthy body, a mind at peace, a loving family, time to do what you love.
- Hit the gym. Avoid drama. Smell nice. Make money. Level up your circle. Talk less. Pray more. Think highly of yourself. Sex, sun, rest, exercise, diet, self-respect, real friends, money, gratitude, discipline, laughter, purpose, peace of mind, mental clarity, meditation, growth, time in nature.
- When you watch sports on TV, you are watching other men live out their dreams while you doing nothing for your own dreams. You are a Dream Cuck.
- Poor people spend to be seen. Wealthy people spend to be invisible.
- Stop wasting time on fake achievements. Learn to fight, build, or make money. Real men create, not escape.

Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3." (...)

#### On travel

> *"Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain."  
-- Jack Kerouac [1922]*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with «lifers»: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

> *"What gives value to travel is fear."  
-- Albert Camus [1913]*

-- x@nikitabier*

### On success

> *"Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it."  
-- Marva Collins [1936]*

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period. Succeeding means securing advantage.

	SUCCESS = EDUCATION + ACTION

Success (and happiness) is internal not external. True fulfillment comes from living not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material. When people finally became a «success» they realize that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100K in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them.

Hints:

- The true measure of success is a calm nervous system.
- Success is a collection of well curated failures.
- The most successful people are those who are good at plan b.

> *"Success lies in relentless execution of the basics."  
-- Leonardo Da Vinci [1452]*

> *"I failed my way to success."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"The way to succeed is to double your failure rate."  
-- Thomas John Watson Sr. [1874]*

> *"Strive not to be a success, but rather be of value."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man."  
-- Louis L’amour [1908]*

> *"Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming."  
-- John Wooden [1910]*

> *"Most overnight successes take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly." (...)

-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

-- Bill Gates [1955]*

> *"The secret to success is retaining your child-like qualities."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"Anything that is successful is a series of mistakes."  
-- Billie Armstrong [1972]*

> *"The success formula: solve your own problems and freely share the solutions." (...)  
"The price of growth is outgrowing people." (...)  
"Predicting failure is easier than predicting success." (...)  
"If you could literally just sit for 30 minutes and be happy, you are successful."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Want to get ahead in life? Start genuinely rooting for others to succeed. It’s as simple as that."  
-- Sahil Bloom [1991]*

> *"Your current results are just the visible output of your old decisions compounding over time. But since people evaluate based on short-term signals, they often misinterpret whether something is actually working. This is why so many businesses & individuals chase surface level metrics instead of real durable progress. Early effort often leads to decline before real takeoff, but most people quit before the inflection point."  
-- x@signulll*

> *"Pride keeps people poor more than laziness does."  
-- x@zubymusic*

#### On barriers to success

> *"Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right."  
-- Henry Ford [1863]*

Fear, not failure, is the biggest barrier to success. Some people are terrified of success, they may be forced to buy a suit.

We don’t get successful by knowing everything, we get successful by listening.

> *"Success and rest don’t sleep together."  
-- vox populi*

> *"If you want to be successful, you must respect one rule – never lie to yourself."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

> *"If you didn’t get what do you want, it’s a sign that you didn’t really wanted it or you bargained the price."  
-- Robert Kiyosaki [1947]*

> *"There is no formula for success, but there are two formulas for failure: not trying and not persisting."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Leave the house before you find something worth staying in for."  
-- Banksy [1974]*

> *"Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will."  
-- Suzy Kassem [1975]*

> *"The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion."  
-- Sam Altman [1985]*






## On conflicts

> *"War is what happens when language fails."  
-- Margaret Atwood [1939]*

Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it. Rotten peace builds resentment.

Small (but relevant) conflicts will grow into big conflicts. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship.

> *"War spares not the brave, but the cowardly."  
-- Anacreon [-573]*

> *"War is delightful to those who have had no experience of it." 
-- Desiderius Erasmus [1466]*

-- Jean-Jacques Rousseau [1712]*

> *"Never argue. In society nothing must be discussed; give only results."  
-- Benjamin Disraeli [1804]*

> *"You cannot find peace by avoiding life."  
-- Virginia Woolf [1882]*

> *"At the core of every major conflict between human beings there is a trust problem."  
-- x@rapahelz*

### On conflict resolution

> *"In college I used to work on the conflict resolution team at a local concert venue. Ultimate tool to de-escalate almost any situation? A genuine smile."  
-- x@realestatetrent*

You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Hints:

- Use «we». Mean it and take responsability.
- Bring options to the table. It’s easier to negotiate down.

> *"A quarrel is quickly settled when deserted by one party; there is no battle unless there be two."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

> *"If they are wise, do not quarrel with them; if they are fools, ignore them."

-- Balthasar Gracian [1601]*

> *"My father used to say, «don’t raise your voice». Improve your argument."  
-- (archbishop) Desmond Tutu [1931]*

> *"To quiet a crowd or a drunk, just whisper. Calm is contagious." (...)  
"Your best response to an insult is «you’re probably right». Often they are."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Do you know how I stopped getting protesters to my event at universities? I held them in the morning."  
-- Jordan Peterson [1962]*
