# 3.1 - On preparing action

## On creativity

<!--
> *"Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may *not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any body.*
> *"The best defense against logic is ignorance.*

- If you want new ideas read old books.
- Be creative: Creativity conquers jealousy, envy, self-pity and worry. 52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything. e.g. water, blueberries, green tea, avocados, leafy green vegetables, fatty fish, water, dark chocolate, flax seeds and nuts

> *"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

Creative minds are rarely tidy. We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. More than addition, creativity is subtraction.

> *"What is now proved, was once only imagined."  
-- William Blake [1757]*

> *"One’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."  
-- Oliver Wendell Holmes [1809]*

> *"To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

> *"Everything that can be invented has been invented."  
-- Charles Holland Duell [1850]*

> *"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent. Curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism, have brought me to my ideas." (...)  
"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand." (...)  
"Creativity is intelligence having fun."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"Everything you can imagine is real." (...)  
"I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else."  
-- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

> *"A pile of rocks ceases to be a rock when somebody contemplates it with the idea of a cathedral in mind."  
-- Antoine de Saint Exupery [1900]*

> *"Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing."  
-- Salvador Dali [1904]*

> *"Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things."  
-- Theodore Levitt [1925]*

> *"Imagination should be used not to escape reality, but to create it."  
-- Colin Wilson [1931]*

> *"When nothing is sure, everything is possible."  
-- Margaret Drabble [1939]*

> *"Negativity is the enemy of creativity."  
-- David Lynch [1946]*

> *"I don’t dream at night, I dream all day. I dream for a living."  
-- Steven Spielberg [1946]*

> *"Good artists copy; great artists steal."  
-- Steve Jobs {popularized by} [1955]*

> *"Chaos is needed for innovation. Structure makes those ideas useful." (...)  
"The ability to see order in chaos is called creativity."  
-- Simon Sinek [1973]*

> *"If you don’t imagine, nothing ever happens at all."  
-- John Green [1977]*

### How to find good ideas?

> *"The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away."  
-- Linus Pauling [1901]*

Best ideas come from the market, not from you. Changes in the environment unlock opportunities.

Creativity is a muscle. Without new experiences, it atroffiates. Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Ignorance is a blessing, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Conventional people living conventional lives lead to conventional ideas.

> *"Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"Nearly every man who develops an idea works it up to the point where it looks impossible, and then he gets discouraged. That’s not the place to become discouraged."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

> *"If you want a new idea read an old book."  
-- Ivan Pavlov & others [1849]*

> *"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them." (...)  
"The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours."  
-- Amos Tversky [1937]*

> *"Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Using creativity to solve problems cannot be taught, and it’s ultimately what free markets pay for." (...)  
"A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to create anything great."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process."  
-- Josh Waitzkin [1976]*

### How to judge ideas?

> *"If everyone thinks it’s a good idea, you already missed the opportunity."  
-- x@alexhormozi*

Ask peers. Managers will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

However the right idea not executed is worth nothing and a mediocre one well executed can be worth much. So focus on transforming yourself into the kind of person who can bring them to life. 

> *"A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right man’s brow."  
-- Ovid [-039]*

> *"In order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes [1547]*

> *"There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come."  
-- Victor Hugo [1802]*

> *"The man with a new idea is a crank - until the idea succeeds."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the tone of voice in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Almost all really new ideas have a certain aspect of foolishness when they are just produced."  
-- Alfred North Whitehead [1861]*

> *"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have."  
-- Émile-Auguste Chartier [1868]*

> *"If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there."  
-- F. Scott Fitzgerald [1896]*

> *"New ideas pass through three periods: 1) It can’t be done; 2) It probably can be done, but it’s not worth doing; 3) I knew it was a good idea all along!"  
-- Arthur C. Clarke [1917]*

> *"Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There’s no market for them. There’s no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn’t mean other people will copy it. First they’ll have to be convinced it’s a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else’s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they’ll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they’re more likely to do well with."  
-- hn@yellow_and_gray*

> *"Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing."  
-- hn@dilemma*






## On analysis

<!--
+ x@rapahelz -- The hallmark of clear thinking is skepticism with regard to dominant narratives.
+ x@scottadamssays -- Complexity is always a cover for fraud. In every domain.
+ x@wordgrammer -- Reality is very complex. If you try to understand every situation from every possible perspective, you will spend all of your time learning, but you won’t get anything done. Biases are good.
> *"Reality is that which does not go away when you stop thinking about it."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*
> *"All rumors about a public figure are to be deemed untrue until he threatens to sue."  -- Nassim Taleb [1960]*
> *"All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight, but the Lord weighs the motives."  -- Proverbs 16:2*

- if you want to understand how to fix a problem in the world, you have to ask who is profiting from the problem. Not who is suffering from it.
- It's less about the past men than the future men. Past actions predict future actions. Hoeing around, then getting scared and wanting to "settle down", is basically a guarantee that she has no intention of changing her behavior. She's just realizing how much she has to lie. Never forget: Your word is your power.
- We overlook major flaws in those we like. And exaggerate minor faults in those we don’t.

> *"There are no facts, only interpretations."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

Analysis is an art, not a science. The main problem with analysis is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

I don’t trust words. I even question actions. But I never doubt patterns.

-- Claude Monet [1840]*

> *"He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp posts - for support rather than for illumination."  
-- Andrew Lang [1844]*

> *"To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense the necessity of reflection." (...)  
"It is by logic that we prove, but is by intuition that we discover."  
-- Henri Poincaré [1854]*

-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"When you understand that every opinion is a vision loaded with personal history, you will begin to understand that all judgement is a confession."  
-- Nikola Tesla [1856]*

> *"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"If you want to know how good a surgeon is, don’t ask other doctors. Ask the nurses."*

- As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths - even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision - are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth.
- Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
- if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.
- Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.
- tese antitheses -> syntesis
- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
- Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it. Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts. Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct. You need to search out disconfirming evidence.

Hints:

- True motivations are revealed, not declared.
- Prefer stats than narratives. We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.
- There’s always a good reason and a real reason.
- Look for something that doesn’t make sense. That’s where the gold mine is: «It doesn’t make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden. Don’t try to make sense of the world. It’s too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They’re the ones that will make the assets price move. (Adam Robinson)
- Randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.
- Skepticism is a great servant and a terrible master.
- There’s truth on «group» stereotypes. «Group» opinions self correct themselves.
- We tend to think that the people who agree with us are really smart.
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
- Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.
- «Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.
- Best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence. Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas. Too much info is the main cause of it: you’ll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs. As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.
- Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.
- Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
- Bragging razor: if someone brags assume half. If someone downplays double it.

- A verdade, quando muito desagradável, quando ofende os nossos pruridos sensíveis, quando vai contra a realidade virtual que imaginamos ser a verdadeira, é discurso de ódio?
-->

> *"The truth does not require your participation in order to exist. Bullshit does."  
-- Terence McKenna [1943]*

Truth does not mind to be questioned. A lie does not like being challenged.

In a world of propaganda, the truth is always a conspiracy. If you tell the truth you don’t need to reharse anything.

Hints:

- How do you tell who’s telling the truth? The ones trying to silence other people are the ones lying.
- Call a rich guy poor, and all he will do is smirk. Call a powerful man weak, and all he will do is smirk. Call a charming misogynist a «virgin», and all he will do is smirk. If it affects you, it is true.

## On planning and strategy

<!--
- What you think is your problem is not your problem, your strategy is.  
- 20% of the game is strategy. 80% of the game is not quitting.
- a dream written down with a date becomes a goal. a goal broken down into steps becomes a plan. a plan backed by action becomes reality.
- Don’t tell everyone your plans, instead show them your results.
- The Romans removed the soldiers’ incentive to be a coward and hurt others thanks to a process called decimation. If a legion loses a battle and there is suspicion of cowardice, 10 percent of the soldiers and commanders are put to death, usually by random lottery.

### How to plan?

> *"Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it."  
-- René Descartes [1596]*

Start with a vision. Then look for actionable steps.

Hints:

- Plans are only a starting point. Choose a plan with options. A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality. Too detailed plans (or too general plans) are not useful and a waste of time. The most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
- Don’t sabotage them when they get tedious or too difficult.
- Actions aligned with goals.
- Quality is the best business plan.

> *"The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me."  
-- Ayn Rand [1905]*

> *"A strategy has a single, well defined focus. A strategy lays out a path to be followed. A strategy is made up of parts (tactics). Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus. A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally."

- As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Beliefs lag behind reality. But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
- Blue collar want to feel the same as others. White collar want to feel different from others.
- Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.
- decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no ’skin in the game’ should give estimates.
- everything is a trade-off.
- find 3 people that high expertise but that they discord and listen. take your conclusions
- for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.
- indecision comes from not knowing what you want. they don’t know what matters to them nor have found something larger then themselves to commit to.
- Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.
- Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct.
- people are punished for bad decisions and rarely rewarded for good decisions.
- the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- The Problems With Goals: Goals have an endpoint. Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. Goals can make us complacent or reckless.
- Wait 48 hours before buying stuff
- With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
- you must learn to proceed without certainty.
- Your product is decisions.

> *"May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears."  
-- Nelson Mandela [1918]*

You are evaluated by your decisions. Getting 80% good decisions is exponentially better than 70%.

We think we make choices but our choices are influenced by others. We pick what is familiar.

And what most of us mean when we say we’d like to «change» ourselves is simply that we’d like to make slightly more optimal actions and decisions. Keep your «self» out of your decisions, because most likely, it’s not about «you». Simply ask yourself, «Is this a good thing to do?» Yes? Then go do it."

### How to speed up decisions?

> *"The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action."  
-- Daniel Gilber [1957]*

Fast decisions are a competitive advantage but most people get paralyzed by over thinking. If you don’t decide timely somebody will do it for you.

Hints:
 
- Default to no. (Steve Jobs)
- «Hell yes or no». Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. (Derek Sivers)  
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer. (Warren Buffett)  
- With two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the sort term. Pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality. (Naval Ravikant)
- Choose the one that may produce most serendipity down the line.
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, make it fast and without perfect information. If is irreversible, slow down and ensure that you understand the problem. (Jeff Bezos)
- Optimal decisions occur with 70% of the information. Anything less and you’ll probably make a bad decision. Anything more and you’re probably wasting time on something that is unlikely to change the outcome. (Jeff Bezos)

> *"All models are wrong but some are useful."  
-- George Box [1919]*

A mental model is a functional tool. If you don’t understand its limitations, you don’t understand the model. The practical question is how limited do they have to be to not be useful. 

> *"A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one."  
-- Joan Robinson [1903]*

> *"The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that «right» and «wrong» are absolute; that everything that isn’t perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong."  
-- Isaac Asimov [1920]*

> *"Scientists generally agree that no theory is one hundred percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science."  
-- Yuval Noah Harari [1976]*
