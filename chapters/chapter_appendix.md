# Appendix A - Time

## On past and memory

<!--
> *"Don’t bother fighting the old; just build the new."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

- history books are on the history of power.
- o q antes era rotina, hj é lembrança. never say goodbye because goodbye means going away and going awya means forgetting.

> *"The past doesn’t help understanding the present. It’s the present that helps understanding the past."  
-- José Saramago*

Life becomes easy when you recognize the recurring patterns.

> *"History is the study of change, ironically used as a map of the future."
-- Morgan Housel*

> *"History does not repeat, but it does rhyme."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"The historian is not really interested in the unique, but in what is general in the unique."

-- Unknown*

> *"There are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen."  
-- Vladimir Lenin*

You are your memory.

However you can’t start a new chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one. The past may be a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay. Let go your past failures. They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future. Don’t be a prisoner of your past, it was just a lesson not a life sentence. The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality. Who are you becoming is more important than who you have been.

> *"The past is entirely contained in your head. It is nowhere else. The present is all that exists and that is where you exist." (...)  
"Changing your interpretation of your past is often just as good as changing your past."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"This moment will just be another story someday."  
-- Stephen Chbosky*

-- George Ball*

> *"Death leaves a heartache no one can heal; love leaves a memory no one can steal."  
-- Unknown*

## On present

<!--
- 100 blocks a day -- wait but why
- Futurism is a study of time. Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.
-->

> *"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."  
-- Steve Jobs*

You will die soon.

Act accordingly and don’t postpone joy. Live life like it’s everyone else’s last day. If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, you won’t find it anywhere. Just because you are not where you want to be, doesn’t mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment.

The elderly and dying invariably regret what they didn’t do, not what they did.

> *"Tomorrow, you promise yourself, will be different, yet, tomorrow is too often a repetition of today."  
-- James T. McKay*

> *"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *"Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing."  
-- Benjamin Franklin*

> *"What’s life? Showing up for the people you love, again and again, until you can’t show up anymore."  
-- Rebecca Walker*

> *"Confine thyself to the present."  
-- Marcus Aurelius*

> *"Yesterday is but today’s memory, and tomorrow is today’s dream."  
-- Kahlil Gibran*

> *"Stop measuring days by degree of productivity and start experiencing them by degree of presence."  
-- Alan Watts*

## On future

> *"The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits."  
-- Michaelangelo*

> *"A man without a vision for his future always return to his past."  
-- Unknown*

Dream big.

An ambitious goal sets the bar so high that even a failure can be considered a success by ordinary standards. If your dreams don’t frighten you, they are not big enough.

> *"Rich people think big. Poor people think small."  
-- T. Harv Eker*

> *"Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future." (...)  
"Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"If you don’t imagine, nothing ever happens at all."  
-- John Green*

> *"I dream my painting and I paint my dream."  
-- Vincent van Gogh*

> *"The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up."  
-- Paul Valery*

> *"Dreams are illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you."  
-- Marsha Norman*

> *"Goals are dreams with deadlines."  
-- Diana Scharf Hunt*

Our present (in)actions will compound into the future we will experience – that’s a great way to think about what lies ahead. However, don’t worry, you can’t control much.

> *"I never worry about the future. It comes soon enough."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"No matter what you do or make in life, it will be forgotten. And then people will just make it again and pretend that what you did never happened."  
-- John Hodgman*

> *"History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is «What might I be wrong about?»"  
-- Kevin Kelly*






---
## On growing old

> *"If you arrive to my age and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Nothing is more disgraceful than that an old man should have nothing to show to prove that he has lived long, except his years."  
-- Seneca*

After reaching a certain age, you are no longer seen as an individual; you become an institution and are treated as institutions are. You are expected to behave like a piece of historical furniture, an architectural landmark.

> *"Every one desires to live long, but no one would be old."
-- Jonathan Swift*

> *"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die."  
-- Unknown*

> *"My life was sharply divided in two halves. In the first half, I was always the youngest in the group; in the second half, I was always the oldest. Theer was no transitional period."  
-- Stan Ulam*

> *"Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older."  
-- John Cassavetes*

> *"When you’re young, you have so much time but never enough money. When you’re old you have money but never enough time."  
-- Jon Boorman*

Aging implies wear and tear, often seen as a high price to pay for maturity.

> *"Every day in the mirror I watch death at work."  
-- Jean Cocteau*

> *"Once I was beautiful, now I’m myself."  
-- Anne Sexton*

> *"Forty is the old age of youth; fifty is the youth of old age."  
-- Victor Hugo*

### On maturity

> *"The foundation of maturity: just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

The advantage of aging is that you become more decisive. Maturing is realizing that many things don’t need your comments.

> *"We mature with the damage, not with the years."  
-- Mateus William*

> *"That is the great fallacy: the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public."  
-- Bryan White*

> *"Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it."  
-- George Orwell*

> *"The old believe everything; the middle-aged suspect everything; the young know everything."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Aging is an extraordinary process where you become the person you always should have been."  
-- David Bowie*

### How to slow down the aging process?

> *"A man that lives from memories becames old. One that lives from projects remains young."  
-- Bruno Munari*

People my age are so much older than me.

> *"We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing."  
-- George bernard Shaw*

> *"You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"It takes a very long time to become young."  
-- Pablo Picasso*

> *"An honest man is always a child."  
-- Socrates*

### On retirement

> *"Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Finding a place to die is an important thing to do.

> *"A man dies when he stops working."  
-- Unknown*

> *"All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *"Men fear death, as children fear to go in the dark; and as that natural fear in children is increased with tales, so is the other."  
-- Francis Bacon*

> *"Be a good ancestor. Do something a future generation will thank you for. A simple thing is to plant a tree."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

## On talent

<!--
> *"Intelligence is curiosity. It is that and only that. If you are curious, you are intelligent. If you are not curious, you are not intelligent. In
fact, politically correct be damned, I will say it straight: A general lack of curiosity is a general lack of intelligence. I will even go so far as to say that a general lack of curiosity is the worst of all traits."  
-- Zan Perrion*
> *"Curiosity is a form of creation."  
-- Zan Perrion*
-->

> *"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction."  
-- Ernst F. Schumacher*

> *"The real test of intelligence is if you get what you want from life."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Talent is fragile and it’s the most sensitive envy trigger. To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays

Intelligence is a spectrum, a dog is intelligent also.

> *"I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that’s not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile."  
-- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination." (...)  
"The measure of intelligence is the ability to change."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"The difference between sounding smart and being smart is «I don’t know»."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Intelligence is like a river: the deeper it is, the less noise it makes."  
-- Milwaukee Journal Sentinel*

> *"When stupidity is considered patriotism, it is unsafe to be intelligent."  
-- Isaac Asimov*

### On geniality

> *"In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer*

> *"Most geniuses prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities."  
-- Andy Benoit*

> *"Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet."  
-- Bob Marley*

> *"Andy Warhol is the only genius I’ve ever known with an IQ of 60."  
-- Gore Vidal*

> *"Genious is man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"If a man knows more than others he becomes lonely."  
-- Carl Jung*






---
## On wealth

> *"To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Being rich is being fulfilled.

> *"You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness."  
-- Mr. Money Mustache*

> *"Some people are so poor, all they have is money."  
-- Patrick Meagher*

> *"Being rich is having money; being wealthy is having time."  
-- Stephen Swidr*

> *"No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### On money

Money is a tool; it can be a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams. However, the perpetual pursuit of more is not the path to happiness. Money doesn’t purchase happiness; it buys freedom.

> *"A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"We don’t make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies."  
-- Walt Disney*

> *"It’s nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don’t want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it’s a little like saving sex for your old age."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money."  
-- Voltaire*

> *"After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts."  
-- Aristotle Onassis*

### How to get wealthy (without getting lucky)

> *"You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money; you get rich by saving your time to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Rich people stay rich by living like they’re broke. Broke people stay broke by living like they’re rich."  
-- Unknown*

Making money is not about luck. 

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
- Equip yourself with specialized knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specialized knowledge is what you learn uniquely, not through standard education. If society can teach it to you, it can teach it to others, making you replaceable. You acquire specialized knowledge by following your genuine interests, not just current trends. While you might find it enjoyable, others may see it as hard work. This kind of knowledge is usually passed on through apprenticeships, not traditional schooling. It often involves technical or creative expertise that’s difficult to outsource or automate.  
- Embrace responsability and take business risks under your own name. In exchange, society might grant you more duties, ownership, and influence. The most accountable people usually have unique, public, and bold personal brands, like Oprah, Trump, Kanye, and Elon. 
- Select partners with intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Stay away from cynics and pessimists, as their negative beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
- To become wealthy, offer what society wants but can’t access easily, and do it at a large scale. Pick an industry for long-term projects with similar-minded people. The internet has opened up diverse career options, yet many haven’t realized this. Focus on persistent efforts. In life, the most substantial gains come from building on past progress. Money is a tool for trading experiences. Create valuable experiences to build your wealth. 
- Prioritize building wealth instead of chasing money or status. Wealth involves owning assets that generate income without constant effort. Understand that it’s possible to create wealth ethically. Don’t pay attention to those who focus on status games; they often gain status by criticizing wealth builders. Money is a sensitive topic as many tie their self-worth and identity to their jobs and earnings, reflecting their skills and competence in the market.  
- You won’t achieve significant wealth by simply trading your time for money. To attain financial freedom, you must have ownership or equity in a business or venture.
- When you eventually attain wealth, you will realize that it wasn’t your primary pursuit in the first place.

> *"You spend the first 20 years of being rich accumulating all of this stuff. And then you’ll spend the next 20 years trying to get out of one thing after another to simplify your life."  
-- Peter Mallouk*

> *"To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Money follows execution, not precedes it." (...)  
"Making money is not something that you do - it’s a skill that you learn." (...)   
"Management is the oldest, and most over-rated form of leverage. Capital, media, and code are the modern forms."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### Nearly free stuff

Books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, questions, gratefulness, laugh.






---
## On popularity

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."  
-- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.

> *"The reward for getting on the stage is fame. The price of fame is that you can’t get off stage." (...)  
"If you’re not ready to be hated, you’re not ready to be famous." (...)  
"You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous."
-- Naval Ravikant*






---
## On luck and risk

<!--
> *"I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi."  
-- M. Vázquez Montalban*
> *"Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day."  
-- Paulo Coelho*
> *"Risk is what's left over when you think you've thought of everything."  
-- Carl Richards*
-->

> *"Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve."  
-- Charlie Munger*

Unless you’re winning, life will seem unfair to you.

Bad luck is often bad planning. If you’re sure it’s not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually. The best things in life are born from coincidence. «Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge. «Surprises» only happen when they didn’t repeat on one’s lifetime. Everything is a pattern.

> *"Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous." (...)  
"God is subtle but he is not malicious."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"The devil always takes back his gifts."  
-- Unknown*

### On risk and chance

Risk is everything you left over and didn’t thought about.

	Risk = Threats x Vulnerabilities

Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier. Luck and risk are two faces of the same coin.

> *"Things that come with little help of luck are more resistant to randomness."  
-- Nassim Taleb*

> *"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."  
-- Seneca*

> *"The day you decide to do it is your lucky day."  
-- Unknown*

> *"What do I want to know about investing that we can’t know? The exact role of luck in successful outcomes."  
-- Robert Schiller*






---
## On beauty and style

<!--
- dress like you’re going somewhere better later
- taste may be an instinct for honest signals
-->

> *"If cats looked like frogs we’d realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember."  
-- Terry Pratchett*

A beautiful person always see beauty in others. Beauty grabs attention. Personality grabs the heart.

> *"A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman."  
-- Coco Chanel*

> *"Elegance is a physical quality. If a woman doesn’t have it naked, she’ll never have it clothed."  
-- Karl Lagerfeld*

> *"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"The only thing more mysteriously attractive than beauty is corruption."  
-- Octave Mirbeau*

> *"Many complain of their looks but none of their brains."  
-- Unknown*






---
## On health

> *"You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness."  
-- Allen Tucker*

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

### How to stay healthy?

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.  
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting.  
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated.

> *"The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison."  
-- Ann Wigmore*

> *"You can eat any dessert you want if you take only 3 bites."  
-- Kevin Kelly*






---
## On lifestyle

<!--
- what’s your adrenaline type? velocidade ou fronteira do conhecido
- If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?
-->

> *"I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life."  
-- David Hockney*

We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die. When life becomes about enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

> *"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."  
-- Robert Heinlein*

> *"Each of us, when our day’s work is done, must seek our ideal, whether it be love or pinochle or lobster à la Newburg, or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves."  
-- O. Henry*

> *"Spend extravagantly on the things that you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t."  
-- Ramit Sethi*

> *"Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"I went to collect the few personal belongings which I held to be invaluable: my cat, my resolve to travel, and my solitude."  
-- Colette*

Hints:

- Build a business with the heuristic of «maximize my vacation time». You will often be presented with two options: the lucrative option and the lifestyle option. Don’t play the government’s game.
- Aspire to work 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.  
- Aspire to move past room-mates, commutes, alarm clocks and calendars. (Naval Ravikant)
- Own my house on a few acres with clean water river frontage, and assets I can enjoy & be creative with (car, bike, music equipment, tools, etc)  
- How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life? Geoarbitrage. Car: max 10K. Job: live next to it. Income doesn’t make you rich. spending habits do.  
- The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression.  
- 3 hobbies: one creative, one to keep in shape and one to make money.
- House + work + third place. We drink to loosen our tongues. Feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.  
- I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.  
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.
- Remove unnecessary distractions and obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals. Technology is my slave, not my master. I’m not choosing ignorance. I’m choosing to not watch wrestling.  
- Minimalism doesn’t avoid possession. Only excess. The less you own, the less owns you. Owning less is better than organizing more. Eliminate instead of organizing. All that clutter used to be money. Organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling. Actively declutter makes room for your true treasures and clarify your values. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need. if you don’t love it or use it is clutter. Decluttering is self-care. Clutter is not just physical stuff. It’s old ideas, toxic relationships and bad habits. Clutter is everything that doesn’t support the better self. Storage is a way of warehousing the past.
- Use it or loose it. A tool is useful when passes human level. Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.  
- Buy supplies before you need them. Gadgets after you need them. Three is two. Two is one. One is none.
- You can never be over dressed or over educated but avoid clothing that are more interesting than you are.

> *"At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3." (...)  
"For a great payoff, be especially curious about the things you are not interested in."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Hard work is simply the refuge of people that have nothing to do."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"I drink to make other people more interesting."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"The happiest of all lives is a busy solitude."  
-- Voltaire*

> *"Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination."  
-- Christina Scalise*

> *"Think of each day as a single life."  
-- Seneca*

> *"The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it."  
-- Henry David Thoreau*

> *"He who buys what he does not need, steals from himself."  
-- Unknown*

> *"If a little is not enough for you, nothing is."  
-- Epicurus*

> *"To measure your quality of life, simply do nothing and see how it feels." (...)  
"People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can’t fathom." (...)  
"When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people more happy than you." (...)  
"No routine. I’m famously unscheduled." (...)  
"You should be too busy to do coffee, while still keeping an uncluttered calendar." (...)  
"Develop strategic incompetence - people won’t ask you to do things you hate to do if you’re bad at them."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On travel

> *"Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain."  
-- Jack Kerouac*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.  
- For how long? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days of travel. Frequency beats intensity. 
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with “lifers”: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

> *"What gives value to travel is fear."  
-- Albert Camus*

> *"A vacation + a disaster = an adventure."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"A vacation is a very expensive way to schedule the time to read a book in peace."  
-- Naval Ravikant*






---
## On success

<!--
> *"When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you.
When playing, surround yourself with people happier than you. "  
-- Naval Ravikant*
-->

> *"Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it."  
-- Marva Collins*

	Success = Education + Action

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period. Succeeding means securing advantage.

Success (and happiness) is internal not external. True fulfillment comes from living not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material. When people finally became a «success» they realize that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100K in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them.

> *"If a man gets lost in the mountains, hundreds will search and often two or three searchers are killed. But the next time somebody gets lost, just as many volunteers turn out. Poor arithmetic, but very human. It runs through all our folklore, all human religions, all our literature—a racial conviction that when one human needs rescue, others should not count the price. Weakness? It might be the unique strength that wins us a Galaxy."

> *"If everybody loves you, something is wrong."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

Life is meant to be lived in community but don’t settle for a place where you’re tolerated. Go where you’re celebrated.

Be independent from your family but loyal at the same time. Keep your friends for friendship but work with the skilled and competent. Resist the temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

-- Kevin Kelly*

### How to curate your friends?

You are the average of your friends.

If you’re always the smartest in the room, you’re in the wrong room. When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.

Hints:

- If your absence doesn’t bother them, your presence never mattered.  
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are. People who genuinely want the best for you are very rare and they are usually already wealthy, loved and happy.  
- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.  
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
- You’re never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you. Second step is inviting them to do something. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. You know someone is a friend when you can go long stretches without talking and the talk is right where we left off.
- It’s ok to unfollow people in real life. Don’t let your loneliness tempt you to reconnect with toxic people. You wouldn’t drink poison just because you’re thirsty.  
- Pay attention to who you’re with when you feel your best.  
- Be suspicious of people who like being owed a favor. Especially if it is not a favor you requested.  
- Maintain old friendships.   

> *"Cultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you." (...)  
"Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you." (...)  
"Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Bad friends will prevent you from having good friends."  
-- Unknown*

> *"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you too can become great."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend’s success."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"When you’re in jail, a good friend will be trying to bail you out. A best friend will be in the cell next to you saying, «Damn, that was fun»."  
-- Groucho Marx*

> *"Don’t make a man feel too indebted to you. With many persons it is not necessary to do more than overburden them with favours to lose them altogether: they cannot repay you, and so they retire, preferring rather to be enemies than perpetual debtors."  
-- Balthasar Gracian*

> *"I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better."  
-- Abraham Lincoln*

> *"Brothers love each other when they are equally rich."

## On lovers

<!--
- psycologically the worst feelling is sitting next to a person who means the world you knowing that you men nothing to them.
- I always have this fear that one day you are going to discover that i’m not as great as you once thoght I was.

> *"Both men and women are desperate to revive a broken relationship, to re-create the great love affair they had at the beginning. The difference is that women try to do it while it is ongoing, and men try to do it when it is over."  
-- Zan Perrion*
-->

> *"We accept the love we think we deserve."  
-- Stephen Chbosky*

You attract what you are.

Love is what happens to men and women that don’t know each other. Love doesn’t hurt, expectations do. Every person feels loved in a different form.

Hints:

- We fall in love with someone because of how they make us feel about ourselves.
- We’re always looking for somebody that looks for us. First parents, then a lover. Screens give us 100% attention. Tech is a compensation.
- Man’s loyalty is tested when he has everything. Woman’s loyalty is tested when her man has nothing.
- Arguing and insecurity is anti-seductive. Familiarity is the death of seduction.
- Relationships start with «can we talk» to «we need to talk». Once you start disliking someone, everything they do is irritating to you. A dirty dish by the sink can be a big marriage problem.
- Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.

-- Albert Einstein*

> *"The main purpose of religion is not to affirm that there is a God, but to prevent humans from thinking they are Gods."

And on the first day, men created god. Religion simplify ideas.

## On science

<!--
> *"The price of success in philosophy is triviality."  
-- C. Glymour*
- technology is applied science
- theories are explanations, not predictions. prediction comes after the explanation
- theories are not derived from anything. human minds crete them by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing ideias. we guess.
- science transforms raw materials (resources) into civilization.
- future proof by avoiding dedicated hardware
- making something social destroys truth of it because social groups need consensus to survive - otherwise they fight and can’t get along - and consensus is all about truth seeking.
- social sciences need to appeal to society for funding so they are politically motivated.
- the real diversity that matters is diversity of ideas not diversity of skin color.
- athenian and italian city states and free form usa were hotbeds for innovation. there was lot of competition.
- wild west, the frontire is always filled with crime and scams and weid stuff and people but it’s where innovation occurs also.
- enlightment was a revolution in how people sought knowledge : by trying not to rely on authorithy.

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it’s a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .
3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.
4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.
7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.
8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.
9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.
10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.
11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.
12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.
13. Design is based on requirements. There’s no justification for designing something one bit "better" than the requirements dictate.
16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.
17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.
20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.
23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.
27. (Varsi’s Law) Schedules only move in one direction.
29. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.
30. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist’s concept.
31. (Mo’s Law of Evolutionary Development) You can’t get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.
32. (Atkin’s Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don’t show up.
33. (Patton’s Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
34. (Roosevelt’s Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
35. (de Saint-Exupery’s Law of Design) A designer knows that they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
37. (Henshaw’s Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame.
40. (McBryan’s Law) You can’t make it better until you make it work.
41. There’s never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there’s always enough time to do it over.
43. You really understand something the third time you see it (or the first time you teach it.)
44. (Lachance’s Law) "Plenty of time" becomes "not enough time" in a very short time.

> *"Asymmetric opportunities: invest in startups. Start a company. Create a book, podcast, video. Create a (software) product. Go on many first dates. Go to a cocktail party. Read a Lindy book. Move to a big city. Buy bitcoin. Tweet."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"If you want to be wealthy, spend your time earning, learning, or relaxing. Outsource or ignore everything else."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Venture funds sell brand for the right to invest money."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"I'm not interested in anything that's not sustainable. Friendships, investing, careers, podcasts, reading habits, exercise habits. If I can't keep it going, I'm not interested in it."  
-- Morgan Housel*

> *"I succeeded because I have a long attention span. (...)  
"Waiting helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can’t stand to wait."  
-- Charlie Munger*

The secret of healthy finances is not to make more money but to keep some.

Hints:

- Spend less than you make. Saving 10% of all paychecks is a good start.
- Stay liquid, avoid investing in anything you can’t sell in a month or two. 
- Diversify with uncorrelated investment bets (barbell strategy).

> *"Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Money just comes to me because I know where to stand."  
-- Chelsea Lazkani*

> *"When volatility or drawdowns are large, the price contains no information." (...)  
"400% up is equivalent to 80% down. And when you look at graphs use log scale. Linear is uninformative."  
-- Nassim Taleb*

> *"Gold is money. Everything else is credit."  
-- J.P. Morgan*

### On investment comfort zone

> *"When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits."  
-- Warren Buffett*

Scared money never wins. It’s all about the risk of losing money versus the risk of missing opportunity. 

> *"The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket."  
-- Kin Hubbard*

### How to spot good investments?

> *"It’s not what you buy. It’s what you pay. There is no asset which is so good that it can’t be overpriced and very few assets which are so bad that they can’t be underpriced. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism."  
-- Howard Marks*

Don’t buy on future hopes, buy on past mistakes. We don’t loose money on star businesses, we loose money on businesses we think will be star businesses.

Hints:

- What’s going to stay the same in the next ten years. While boring, offer the best investment opportunities.  
- Where is low optimism. Recessions are caused when a bunch of people lose confidence all at once.  
- Know who are the buyers, the sellers and their motivations.  
- Investments are competing with each other.  
- The best companies aren’t sold, they’re bought. Stay away from junk stocks.
- The more you know, the less you need to diversify. Diversification is an hedge against lack of knowledge.  
- Take risk from the table whenever possible.  

> *"What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital." (...)  
*"Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand. You must learn to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds." (...)  
*"You’re looking for a mispriced gamble."  
-- Charlie Munger*

> *"Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the real rent of land."  
-- Adam Smith*

> *"What’s my religion? Arbitrage and rents."  
-- E. Ferreira*

> *"If someone is trying to convince you it’s not a pyramid scheme, it’s a pyramid scheme."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

## On education

<!--
- polymaths are late bloomers. -- robin hanson
- if you're not surprised you're not really learning.
- you get rewarded for unique knowledge, not effort. effort is required to create unique knowledge. -- naval
- don't be so busy preparing for teh future that you never step into it. the satisfaction of binge consumption brings instant gratification, so whty try anything else? the problem with shoving information is the ilusion of knowledge, especially when you rush it.true learning requires comtemplation. And implementation. And a commitment to reflecting on great ideas over and over again.
- school's real study topic is obedience.
- timeless: science, math, philosophy, rhetoric. First principles. Creating art & business. Family & lifelong friends. Habits to calm mind & body. Temporary: politics, news, estertainment. memrizing facts. hourly work. transactional relationships. drugs & doctors for mind and body. -- naval
- school failed to: how to build self confidence / how to be good with money / dating and relationships skills / confrontation skills / critical thinking / creative productivity.
- study math to understand physics. study physics to understand chemistry. study chemistry to understand biology. study biology to understand psychology. study psychology to understand economics. study economics and philosophy to be free. -- naval
- the biggest mistake anyone makes when studying a foreign language is that they do it little by little, not jumping into it head first. language is not mathematics; one doen't need to learn it, one needs to get accustomed to it. it's not about logic or memory; it's about experience and skill.
- the problem is not, and never have been, "as good as a professional". It has always been "it's good enoughto replace a professioanl so it'll be cheaper."
- the key thing about AI is that AI+human is waht we'll do.

> *"Education is kindling a flame, not the filling of a vessel."  
-- Socrates*

> *"It’s a universal law. Intolerance is the first sign of an inadequate education. An ill-educated person behaves with arrogant impatience, whereas truly profound education breeds humility."  
-- Alexander Solzhenitsyn*

A college education may help you make a living. Self-education may make you a fortune. The value of formal education is signaling, rather than actual learning. The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships.

Education leads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward a final self-definition. School rewards generalists, the world not so.

> *"«I want to have a safety net so I can get a job.» This is what my daughter said to me. Where did she learn the phrase «safety net»?
Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult. It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were. It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you. I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears. So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up."  
-- James Altucher*

> *"Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"If you need a degree to do it, it’s not going to make you wealthy."  
"Learning is cheap, education is expensive." (...)   
"Given that the main funcion of universities these days is filtering and signaling, the best move is to get admitted to Stanford and then drop out." (...)  
"The overeducated are worse off than the undereducated, having traded common sense for the illusion of knowledge." (...)  
"The modern conceit - educated people think they can outsmart complex systems like evolution, capitalism, weather and biology." (...)  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Education is what survives when what has been learnt has been forgotten."  
-- B.F. Skinner*

> *"Learning is a treasure that will follow it’s owner everywhere."  
-- Unknown*

Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory and persuasion.

> *"The strongest intellectual foundation is built upon science, math and philosophy, as they are the search for universal truths." (...)  
"The ideal school would teach health, wealth and happiness. It would be self-paced and available to all. It would show opposing ideas and students would self-verify truth. No grades, no tests, no diplomas - just learning. Actually you’re already here. Careful who you follow."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

## On reading

> *"I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

Reading trains your model of the world. Even if you forget most, its effect persists.

> *"A book is less important for what it says than for what it makes you think."  
-- Louis L’amour*

> *"Every time I read a great book I felt I was reading a kind of map, a treasure map, and the treasure I was being directed to was in actual fact myself."

-- Abraham Lincoln*

-- Gail Carson Levine*

> *"Think before you speak. Read before you think."  
-- Fran Lebowitz*

> *"No book is worth reading that isn’t worth rereading."  
-- Susan Sontag*

> *"One cannot read a book: one can only reread it. A good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a rereader."  
-- Nabokov*

> *"I have never met a person I admired who did not read more books than I did."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them."  
-- Ray Bradbury*

### On classics

Don’t read the books made to make money, read the ones they want to ban. Most books are propaganda.

> *"The great books are the books that never have to be written again."  
-- Carl Van Doren*

> *"A classic is a book which people praise and don’t read."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"The worst thing about new books is that they keep us from reading the old ones."

> *"When the reader is ready the book appears."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

## On writing

<!--
- o poeta faz a sintese das coisas
5. I wrote down the funny stuff I overheard. I learned to be like a ship's rat, veined ears trembling, and i learned to scribble it all down.
9. good writing is about telling the truth. we are species that needs and wants to understand who we are.
13. become a better writer is going to help you become a better reader, and that is the real payoff.
15. e.l.doctorow once said that: "writing a novel is like driving a car at night. you can see only as far as your headlights, but you can make the hole trip that way."
45. when people shine a little light on their monster, we find out how similar most of our monsters are.
46. we write to expose the unexposed. If there's one door in teh castle you have been told not to go through, you must. Otherwise, you'll just be rearranging furniture in rooms you've already been in.
47. Annie Dillard has said that day by day you have to give the work before you all teh best stuff you have, not saving up for later projects. If you give freely, there will always be more.
49. becoming a writer is about becoming conscious.
50. you can either set a brick as a laborer or as an artist.

> *"Tears are words that need to be written."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

> *"I write to give myself strength. I write to be the characters that I am not. I write to explore all the things I’m afraid of."  
-- Joss Whedon*

If you are writing to be read you are doing it wrongly. Write to learn not to teach. If you have lived a diverse life you’ll have a lot to say.

> *"The purpose of literature is to turn blood into ink."  
-- T.S. Eliot*

> *"The pen is the tongue of the mind."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes*

-- E.B. White*

> *"Write drunk. Edit sober."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"Any word you have to hunt for in a thesaurus is the wrong word."  
-- Stephen King*

-- Chris Cornell*

> *"I have made this letter longer then usual because I lacked the time to make it shorter."  
-- Blaise Pascal*

> *"I write because I don’t know what I think until I read what I say."  
-- Flannery O’Connor*

> *"The biggest lie we tell ourselves is «I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.»"
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.  
So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music"  
-- Gary Provost*

### On email

Hints:

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.  
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.  
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.

-- Knoll’s law*

News are the first draft of History but he human brain was not designed to process all of the world’s emergencies in realtime. Journalism is now activism. It’s the only way to get eyeballs. Media companies harvest your attention and transform it into revenue. 

> *"The clash of ideas is the sound of freedom.
-- Lady Bird Johnson*

> *"If you’re writing for your followers, your followers are worthless." (...)  
"The more people in the conversation the harder it becomes to speak the unconfortable truth. Social media puts everybody in the same conversation."

alan perlis - 105. You can’t communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.
alan perlis - 120. Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new machines to behave like old ones.

We’ve grown dependent on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.

-- Albert Einstein*

> *"If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is."  
-- John von Neumann*
