# Appendix A - Time

## On past and memory

<!--
- history books are on the history of power.
-->

> *'The past doesn’t help understanding the present. It’s the present that helps understanding the past.' -- José Saramago*

> *'History does not repeat, but it does rhyme.' -- Mark Twain*

Life becomes very easy when you have studied the past and recognize the recurring patterns.

> *'The historian is not really interested in the unique, but in what is general in the unique.' -- Edward Carr*

> *'Every new medium transforms the nature of human thought. In the long run, history is the story of information becoming aware of itself.' -- James Gleick*

> *'The years say, what the days can’t tell.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'Life is understood backwards, but must be lived forwards.' -- Soren Kierkegaard*

> *'Collective memory is more about the present than the past because it is integral to how the group sees itself.' -- Margaret MacMillan*

> *'Memory is never a precise duplicate of the original; instead, it is a continuing act of creation.' -- Rosalind Cartwright*

You are your memory, however you can’t start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one.

Let go your past [failures](chapter_1_self.md#on-mistakes-and-failure): they are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future. The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality.

> *'Death leaves a heartache no one can heal; love leaves a memory no one can steal.' -- Irish saying*

> *'This moment will just be another story someday.' -- Stephen Chbosky*

> *'Keep in mind that people change, but the past doesn’t.' -- Becca Fitzpatrick*

> *'I can't go back to yesterday because I was a different person then.' -- Lewis Carroll*

> *'He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *'Never regret something that once made you smile.' -- Amber Deckers*

> *'Stop looking for happiness in the same place where you lost it.' -- Unknown*

> *'I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'The worst part of holding the memories is not the pain. It's the loneliness of it. Memories need to be shared.' -- Lois Lowry*

### How memory works?

It’s harder to forget mistakes, past events and the beginning or the end of something. 

> *'You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget.' -- Cormac McCarthy*

> *'You don’t remember what happened. What you remember becomes what happened.' -- John Green*

## On present

<!--
- 100 blocks a day -- wait but why  
- Leave a trail of accomplishments or smiles behind you.
> *'When you’re young, you have so much time but never enough money. When you’re old you have money but never enough time.' -- Jon Boorman*
-->

> *'Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.' -- Steve Jobs*

> *'Tomorrow, you promise yourself, will be different, yet, tomorrow is too often a repetition of today.' -- James T. McKay*

You will die soon.

Act accordingly and don’t postpone joy. Live life ready to meet God like it’s everyone else’s last day. If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, you won’t find pleasure anywhere. Just because you are not where you want to be, doesn’t mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment. Learn to reframe your current situation and find meaning within it.

The elderly and dying invariably lament on what they neglected to do, not what they did.

> *'Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing.' -- Benjamin Franklin*

> *'Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *'What’s life? Showing up for the people you love, again and again, until you can’t show up anymore.' -- Rebecca Walker*




---
## On future

> *'The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits.' -- Michaelangelo*

> *'If you don’t imagine, nothing ever happens at all.' -- John Green*

Dream big.

If your dreams don’t scare you, they are not big enough. Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.

> *'I dream my painting and I paint my dream.' -- Vincent van Gogh*

> *'Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Rich people think big. Poor people think small.' -- T. Harv Eker*

> *'Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future.' -- Oscar Wilde*

Our present (in)actions will ‘compound’ into the future we will get – that’s a great way to think about what lies ahead. However, don’t worry too much, you can’t control much.

> *'I never worry about the future. It comes soon enough.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'No matter what you do or make in life, it will be forgotten. And then people will just make it again and pretend that what you did never happened.' -- John Hodgman*

> *'Be a good ancestor. Do something a future generation will thank you for. A simple thing is to plant a tree.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is “What might I be wrong about?”' -- Kevin Kelly*




---
## On growing old

> *'All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *'We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing.' -- George bernard Shaw*

> *'Every day in the mirror I watch death at work.' -- Jean Cocteau*

Aging implies damage.

> *'A man that lives from memories becames old. One that lives from projects remains young.' -- Bruno Munari*

> *'Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself.' -- Anne Sexton*

> *'Finding a place to die is an important thing to do.' -- Nagasaki*

> *'We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public.' -- Bryan White*

### On maturity

> *'The foundation of maturity: Just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'One advantage of getting older - you become more decisive' -- Naval Ravikant*

> *'Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older.' -- John Cassavetes*




---
# Appendix B - On envy triggers

## On talent

> *'In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction.' -- Ernst F. Schumacher*

Talent is fragile and it’s the most sensitive envy trigger.

Intelligence is a spectrum, a dog is intelligent also. To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays.

> *'I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that’s not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile.' -- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *'Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see.' -- Arthur Schopenhauer*

> *'Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet.' -- Bob Marley*

> *'Most geniuses prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities.' -- Andy Benoit*

> *'Recipe for genius into one sentence: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters.' -- Paul Graham*

> *'We like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy.' -- Paul Graham*

> *'The true test of intelligence is not how much we know how to do, but how to behave when we don’t know what to do.' -- John Holt*

> *'The measure of intelligence is the ability to change.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Andy Warhol is the only genius I’ve ever known with an IQ of 60.' -- Gore Vidal*




---
## On wealth

<!--
- money is freedom. why do u want fu money if you don't say fu.
-->

> *'Some people are so poor, all they have is money.' -- Patrick Meagher*

> *'You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness.' -- Mr. Money Mustache*

Being rich is being fulfilled.

Money is a tool. It can be a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams but the perpetual chase for more is not the path that leads to more freedom and happiness.

> *'A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'We don’t make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies.' -- Walt Disney*

> *'It’s nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don’t want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it’s a little like saving sex for your old age.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money.' -- Voltaire*

> *'After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts.' -- Aristotle Onassis*

### How to get wealthy (without getting lucky)

- Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. Money is not the cause of wealth in one’s life. It is the effect. Similarly, when people assume that money is the cause of their problems, they are actually mistaken. Money is usually the most noticeable effect of their problems. Money is a touchy subject. That’s because most of us, to a certain degree, associate a lot of our self-worth and identity to our job and how much money we make. It is, quite literally, a market valuation of our skills and competence as a person.  
- You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet. Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. Money is inherently neutral. It’s merely a vessel for the exchange of experience between two people. You make your money by creating experiences for others.  
- Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. 
- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.  
- Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.  
- You cannot save your way to wealth.
- When you’re finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place.

> *'To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'You spend the first 20 years of being rich accumulating all of this stuff. And then you’ll spend the next 20 years trying to get out of one thing after another to simplify your life.' -- Peter Mallouk*

> *'To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### Nearly free stuff

Books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, gratefulness, experiences, laugh, notice, questions.




---
## On popularity

> *'There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses' -- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.

> *'You really don’t want to be famous. Read the biography of any famous person.' -- Kevin kelly*

> *'You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous.' -- Naval Ravikant*

> *'The reward for getting on the stage is fame. The price of fame is that you can't get off stage.' -- Naval Ravikant*




---
## On luck and risk

<!--
> *'Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day.' -- Paulo Coelho*
> *'I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi.' -- M. Vázquez Montalban*
-->

> *'Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *'If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve.' -- Charlie Munger*

Unless you’re winning, life will seem unfair to you, but, bad luck is often bad planning. If you’re sure it’s not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually. There’s no magic in the world, it’s all math. The best things in life are born from coincidence.

«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge. «Surprises» only happen when they didn't repeat on one's lifetime.

> *'God is subtle but he is not malicious.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Good fortune: good character, good intentions, good actions.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

### On chance

Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

> *'Things that come with little help of luck are more resistant to randomness. People who look too close to randomness burn out. The only article lady fortuna has no control over is your behaviour. Good luck.' -- Nassim Taleb*

### On risk

Risk is everything you left over and didn't thought about. Luck and risk are two faces of the same coin.






---
## On beauty and style

> *'If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember.' -- Terry Pratchett*

> *'Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman.' -- Coco Chanel*

A beautiful person always see beauty in others.

> *'A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society.' -- Mark Twain*




---
## On health

> *'You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness.' -- Allen Tucker'*

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

### How to keep healthy?

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.  
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting.  
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated. Sleep deprivation is bad for memory. Stress also.

> *'You can eat any dessert you want if you take only 3 bites.' -- Kevin Kelly*




---
## On lifestyle

<!--
> *'Dance with your hips.' -- Kevin Kelly*
- If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?
- feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
- I'm not choosing ignorance. I'm choosing to not watch wrestling.
- My life has been a series of questions and odd experiments.
-->

> *'I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life.' -- David Hockney*

> *'A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects.' -- Robert Heinlein*

We were designed to [walk dozens of miles each day](#on-travel-and-nomadism), catch our own meals, [live in a close-knit tribe](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-family-and-friends), [have regular sex](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-relationships), [raise children](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-feedback-and-mentorship) and die.
When life becomes about [enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff](#on-money-and-wealth), we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

> *'Each of us, when our day’s work is done, must seek our ideal, whether it be love or pinochle or lobster à la Newburg, or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves.' -- O. Henry*

> *'Spend extravagantly on the things that you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t.' -- Ramit Sethi*

> *'Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'I went to collect the few personal belongings which I held to be invaluable: my cat, my resolve to travel, and my solitude.' -- Colette*

Hints:

- 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.  
- House + work + third place.
- Essencialism: the disciplined pursuit of less. Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication. Eliminating clutter makes room for your true treasures. The end goal is to clarify your values.
- Own my house on a few acres with clean water river frontage, and assets i can enjoy & be creative with (car, bike, music equipment, tools etc)  
- I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.  
- The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression.  
- How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life? Geoarbitrage. Car: max 10K. Job: live next to it.  
- In life, you will often be presented with two options: the lucrative option and the lifestyle option. Don’t play the government’s game.

### How to simplify?

<!--
- One of the biggest mistakes that people make is that they are outcome oriented, not process oriented.
-->

- Use it or loose it. A tool is useful when passes human level. Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.  
- Remove unnecessary distractions and obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals.  
- If you are looking for something, and you finally find it, when you’re done with it, don’t put it back where you found it but where you first looked for it. (Kevin Kelly)




---
## On success

<!--
- (kk) Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up.

> *'The pain I feel now is the happiness I had before. That’s the deal.' -- C.S. Lewis*
- silicon valley celebrate failure only after they achieve success
- And when they finally became a “success” they realized that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100,000 in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them. They worked tirelessly to achieve goals that they didn’t truly care about.
- Success is Internal not External: If you want to achieve true fulfillment, then realize that happiness is internal. True fulfillment comes from living your life, not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material “The things we do that get us to feel the true, deep sense of accomplishment are things like running a marathon, climbing a mountain, writing a book, and inventing something,”
- sucesses keep you making the same stuff, mistakes not.
- It’s never your identity, it’s always your strategy
- Succeeding means securing advantage.
- Do what works and forget the rest. But the simple truth is that success leaves clues. There are certain habits, patterns, and routines that lead to your success, and there are certain patters that will result in failure.
-->

> *'Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it.' -- Marva Collins*

> *'If you didn’t get what do you want, it’s a sign that you didn’t really wanted it or you bargained the price.' -- Roger Kipling*

Success = education + massive action

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period of time. But success is not being wealthy, is being happy.

> *'Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming.' -- John Woode*

> *'A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do.'*

> *'To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man.' -- Louis L'amour*

> *'Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Most overnight successes take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly.' -- Kevin Kelly*

Fear, not failure, is the biggest barrier to success. Some people are terrified of success, they may be forced to buy a suit..

> *'Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will.'*

> *'Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right.' -- Henry Ford*

But success is a dangerous word. I don’t know any successful person.




---
# Appendix C - Others

## On wisdom

> *'Wisdom is nothing more profound than an ability to follow one’s own advice.' -- Sam Harris*

> *'Being wise means having more questions than answers.' -- Kevin Kelly*

Wisdom is knowing the long-term consequences of your actions.




---
## On truth
<!--
> *'It's the nature of truth that once you see it, you can't unsee it. -- Naval Ravikant*
> *'If it hurts to hear, look for the truth in it. If it comforts to hear it, look for the lie in it.' -- Naval Ravikant
-->

The only thing worth praying is truth.

## On comedy

<!--
- "the grass is always greener on the side that is fertilized with bulshit"
> *'In Europe 100 miles is a long way, In the US 100 years is a long time'* 
> *'When I'm good, I'm very good, but when I'm bad, I'm better.' -- Mae West*
> *'I wrote the story myself. It’s about a girl who lost her reputation and never missed it.' -- Mae West*
> *'La que no es puta non desfruta.'*
> *'Já vi o fim do mundo algumas vezes e na manhã seguinte estava tudo bem.'*
> *'The four most expensive words in the English language: «This time is different».'
- which is more hipster: using the latest modern web framework, or bragging about how you don’t use modern web frameworks?
- overheard someone say in a SF cafe: "I couldn’t be a doctor...it doesn’t change the world enough and you don’t actually earn that much.
-->

> *'Only the truth is funny.' -- Rick Reynolds*

Comedians are the modern day philosophers.

Comedy is about observing the hidden truths in life that everyone knows but nobody has ever quite articulated. This is why the 
Standup is about articulating that truth in such a way that people feel momentarily unsafe and confused (the setup), and relieved (the punchline).

> *'Anastas, the taste of ice cream interests you more than the construction of communism!' -- Joseph Stalin to Anastas Mikoyan*

> *'Sex, like pizza, when it’s good is good. When it’s bad it gets in your shirt.'*

> *'There’s a great joke about an automated car plant in Japan, where the machines work in the dark and there are only two living things authorized to be on the factory floor – a man and a dog.  
What’s the man there for? His job is to feed the dog.  
What’s the dog for? The dog keeps the man from touching any of the machines.'*

-->

## On humanness and irrationality

> *'If a man gets lost in the mountains, hundreds will search and often two or three searchers are killed. But the next time somebody gets lost, just as many volunteers turn out. Poor arithmetic, but very human. It runs through all our folklore, all human religions, all our literature—a racial conviction that when one human needs rescue, others should not count the price. Weakness? It might be the unique strength that wins us a Galaxy.' -- Robert Heinlein on Starship Troopers*

Most people approach each and every year in the exact same way while (somehow) expecting drastically different results.

How to write compelling characters? “It’s easy,” he said. “Just make them contradictions.” To be human is to be a contradiction.

> *'If there is one thing you can count on, it’s human greed. And I'm not pretending I'm above it myself.'*

> *'The problem with people who have no vices is that generally you can be pretty sure they're going to have some pretty annoying virtues.' -- Elizabeth Taylor*

> *'I am lonely, yet not everybody will do. I don’t know why, some people fill the gaps and others emphasize my loneliness. In reality those who satisfy me are those who simply allow me to live with my «idea of them».' -- Anaïs Nin*

> *'I always worried someone would notice me, and then when no one did, I felt lonely.' -- Curtis Sittenfeld*

> *'I don’t want to be alone, I want to be left alone.' -- Audrey Hepburn*

> *'Everybody has a secret world inside of them. I mean everybody. All of the people in the whole world, I mean everybody — no matter how dull and boring they are on the outside. Inside them they've all got unimaginable, magnificent, wonderful, stupid, amazing worlds... Not just one world. Hundreds of them. Thousands, maybe.' -- Neil Gaiman*

> *'People aren’t either wicked or noble. They're like chef’s salads, with good things and bad things chopped and mixed together in a vinaigrette of confusion and conflict.' -- Lemony Snicket*

> *'The whole of science is nothing more than a refinement of everyday thinking.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.' -- Albert Einstein*

Science is the study of truth. Everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief.

- Stock buybacks are effectively same as dividends.
- Answers to what’s going to stay the same in the next ten years, while boring, offer the best investment opportunities.
- entrepreneurship vs investment - 2 different mentalities.
- dealers vs brokers: liquid markets (dealers with enough inventory)
- auctions ao contrario! vendo por 40mil. o q venderes dai para cima 50% é para ti!

The secret to get wealthy is not to make more money but to keep it.

- Diversify with uncorrelated investment bets.
- Barbell strategy.

> *'You’re looking for a mispriced gamble.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'It’s not what you buy. It’s what you pay. There is no asset which is so good that it can’t be overpriced and very few assets which are so bad that they can’t be underpriced. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism.' -- Howard Marks*

> *'What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'What’s my religion? Arbitrage and rents.' -- EF*

### When to fold?

> *'Life, in part, is like a poker game, wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand. You must learn to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds.' -- Charlie Munger*

## On travel and nomadism

<!--
- On adrenaline: what’s your adrenaline type. ex. adrenalina velocidade vs adrenalina de estar na fronteira do conhecido
- (kk) A vacation + a disaster = an adventure.
- (kk) When you are young spend at least 6 months to one year living as poor as you can, owning as little as you possibly can, eating beans and rice in a tiny room or tent, to experience what your “worst” lifestyle might be. That way any time you have to risk something in the future you won’t be afraid of the worst case scenario.
-->

> *'Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain.' -- Jack Kerouac*

> *'What gives value to travel is fear.' -- Albert Camus*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer.   
Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.  
- For how long? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days of travel. Frequency beats intensity. 
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with “lifers”: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.
- Build a business with the heuristic of «maximize my vacation time»: Contracting -> Travelling between contracts -> Travelling while contracting -> Software product business -> Chilling

## On college

> *'The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships.' -- my teacher*

A college education may help you make a living. Self-education may make you a fortune.  
The value of formal education is signaling, rather than actual learning.

School rewards generalists, the world not so.

> *'Self education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. The only function of a school is to make self education easier; failing that, it does nothing.' -- Isaac Asimov*

> *'«I want to have a safety net so I can get a job.» This is what my daughter said to me. Where did she learn the phrase “Safety net”?
Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult. It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were. It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you. I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears. So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up.' -- James Altucher*

> *'Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Given that the main funcion of universities these days is filtering and signaling, the best move is to get admitted to Stanford and then drop out.' -- Naval Ravikant*

Hints:

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.  
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.  
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.

We’ve grown dependent on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.

> *'As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality.' -- Albert Einstein*

<!--
- people of all political persuasions
- introverts have more probability of being an expert in their field. extraversion is not good for mastery. most people are not extremes and most people are in the middle. most things are not binary. introvert is not shyness. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7. It’s hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.
