# Appendix A - Time

## On past and memory

<!--
- history books are on the history of power.
- o q antes era rotina, hj é lembrança. never say goodbye because goodbye means going away and going awya means forgetting.
- there are decades when nothing happens and there are weeks when decades happen.
- history is the study of change, ironically used as a map of the future.
- never be a prisoner of your past. it was just a lesson not a life sentence.
- who are you becoming is more important than who you have been 
-->

> *"The past doesn’t help understanding the present. It’s the present that helps understanding the past."  
-- José Saramago*

Life becomes easy when you recognize the recurring patterns.

> *"History does not repeat, but it does rhyme."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"Don’t bother fighting the old; just build the new."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The historian is not really interested in the unique, but in what is general in the unique."  
-- Edward Carr*

> *"Every new medium transforms the nature of human thought. In the long run, History is the story of information becoming aware of itself."  
-- James Gleick*

> *"The years say, what the days can’t tell."  
-- Chinese proverb*

> *"Life is understood backwards, but must be lived forwards."  
-- Soren Kierkegaard*

You are your memory, however you can’t start the next chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one. The past may be a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay.

Let go your past failures: they are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future. The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality.

> *"The past is entirely contained in your head. It is nowhere else. The present is all that exists and that is where you exist. (...) Changing your interpretation of your past is often just as good as changing your past."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Death leaves a heartache no one can heal; love leaves a memory no one can steal."  
-- Irish saying*

-- Stephen Chbosky*

-- Lewis Carroll*

-- Unknown*

> *"He'd wasted most of his life thinking he'd wasted most of his life'*

> *"Never regret something that once made you smile."  
-- Amber Deckers*

> *"Keep in mind that people change, but the past doesn’t."  
-- Becca Fitzpatrick*

> *"I don’t know any longer whether I’m living or remembering."

-- Lois Lowry*

> *"You never know the value of a moment until it becomes a memory."  
-- Unknown*

> *"A busy mind accelerates the perceived passage of time. buy more time by cultivating peace of mind."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"But how can you live and have no story to tell?"  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky*

### How memory works?

<!--
> *"It takes an huge effort to free yourself from memory."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

It’s harder to forget mistakes, past events and the beginning or the end of something. 

> *"You forget what you want to remember, and you remember what you want to forget."  
-- Cormac McCarthy*

> *"You don’t remember what happened. What you remember becomes what happened."  
-- John Green*

-- Margaret MacMillan*

> *"Nostalgia is a seductive liar."  
-- George Ball (american politician)*

## On present

<!--
> *"Stop measuring days by degree of productivity and start experiencing them by degree of presence."  
-- Alan Watts*

- 100 blocks a day -- wait but why
-->

> *"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."  
-- Steve Jobs*

You will die soon.

Act accordingly and don’t postpone joy. Live life like it’s everyone else’s last day. If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, you won’t find it anywhere. Just because you are not where you want to be, doesn’t mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment. Learn to reframe your current situation and find meaning within it.

The elderly and dying invariably lament on what they neglected to do, not what they did. Leave a trail of accomplishments or smiles behind you.

> *"Tomorrow, you promise yourself, will be different, yet, tomorrow is too often a repetition of today."  
-- James T. McKay*

> *"Either write something worth reading or do something worth writing."  
-- Benjamin Franklin*

> *"Live as if you were to die tomorrow. Learn as if you were to live forever."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *"What’s life? Showing up for the people you love, again and again, until you can’t show up anymore."  
-- Rebecca Walker*

> *"When you’re young, you have so much time but never enough money. When you’re old you have money but never enough time."  
-- Jon Boorman*

> *"Confine thyself to the present."  
-- Marcus Aurelius*






---
## On future

<!--
> *"Dreams are ... illustrations from the book your soul is writing about you."  
-- Marsha Norman*
> *"Myth is the public dream, and dream is the private myth."  
-- Joseph Campbell*
> *"The best way to make your dreams come true is to wake up."  
-- Paul Valery*
> *"Goals are dreams with deadlines."  
-- Diana Scharf Hunt*
> *"Hope is the dream of a waking man."  
-- Diogenes*
> *"Yesterday is but today's memory, and tomorrow is today's dream."  
-- Kahlil Gibran*

- a man without a vision for his future, always return to his past.
- you say I dream too big. i say you dream too small.
- Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.
- futurism is a study of time
-->

> *"The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits."  
-- Michaelangelo*

> *"A man without a vision for his future always return to his past."  
-- Andrew Tate*

Dream big.

If your dreams don’t scare you, they are not big enough. A ambitious goal sets the bar so high that even a failure is a success measured by the ordinary.

> *"If you don’t imagine, nothing ever happens at all."  
-- John Green*

> *"I dream my painting and I paint my dream."  
-- Vincent van Gogh*

> *"Anyone who lives within their means suffers from a lack of imagination."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Rich people think big. Poor people think small."  
-- T. Harv Eker*

> *"Every saint has a past, and every sinner has a future."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

Our present (in)actions will compound into the future we will get – that’s a great way to think about what lies ahead. However, don’t worry too much, you can’t control it.

> *"I never worry about the future. It comes soon enough."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"We all have two lives. The second one starts when we only have one."  
-- Confucius*

> *"No matter what you do or make in life, it will be forgotten. And then people will just make it again and pretend that what you did never happened."  
-- John Hodgman*

> *"Be a good ancestor. Do something a future generation will thank you for. A simple thing is to plant a tree."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"History teaches us that in 100 years from now some of the assumptions you believed will turn out to be wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is «What might I be wrong about?»"  
-- Kevin Kelly*

## On growing old

<!--
> *"If you arrive to my age and nobody thinks well of you, I don't care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster."  
-- Warren Buffett*
> *"Aging is an extraordinary process where you become the person you always should have been."  
-- David Bowie*

-- Socrates*
> *"We mature with the damage, not with the years."  
-- Mateus William*
> *"It takes a very long time to become young."  
-- Pablo Picasso*
“As a grown man you should know better than to go around advising people.” -- Bertolt Brecht

-- Sam Johnson*
> *"Go to Heaven for the climate, Hell for the company."

-- Oscar Wilde*

-- Icelandic proverb*

> *"Old age is too high a price to pay for maturity.*
> *"People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.*
> *"Everybody wants to go to heaven, but nobody wants to die.*
- My life was sharply divided in two halves. In teh first half, I was always the youngest in teh group; in teh second half, I was always the oldest. Theer was no transitional period. -- stan ulam
- after reaching a certain age, you are no longer viewed as a person. you become an institution and are you aere treated the way institutions are. you are expected to behave like a piece of period furniture, an architectual landmark.
- maturing is realizing how many things don't require your comment.
-->

> *"We don’t stop playing because we grow old; we grow old because we stop playing."  
-- George bernard Shaw*

People my age are so much older than me.

> *"A man that lives from memories becames old. One that lives from projects remains young."  
-- Bruno Munari*

> *"All God does is watch us and kill us when we get boring. We must never, ever be boring."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *"Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older."  
-- John Cassavetes*

> *"You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Aging implies damage.

> *"Every day in the mirror I watch death at work."  
-- Jean Cocteau*

> *"Once I was beautiful, now I'm myself."  
-- Anne Sexton*

### On maturity

> *"The foundation of maturity: just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

The advantage of getting older is that you become more decisive.

> *"That is the great fallacy: the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*

> *"We never really grow up, we only learn how to act in public."  
-- Bryan White*

> *"Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it."  
-- Orwell*

### On retirement

Finding a place to die is an important thing to do.

> *"Retirement is when you stop sacrificing today for an imaginary tomorrow."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

# Appendix B - On envy triggers

## On talent

<!--
> *"Intelligence is like a river: the deeper it is, the less noise it makes."  
-- Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (?)*
> *"The test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in the mind at the same time, and still retain the ability to function."  
-- F. *Scott Fitzgerald*
> *"Modesty: The gentle art of enhancing your charm by pretending not to be aware of it."  
-- Oliver Herford*
> *"The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge but imagination."  
-- Albert Einstein*
> *"The best lack conviction, while the worst are full of passionate intensity."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"When someone is kicking your ass, at least you know that you are out in front."  
-- Donald Bartel*

- Modesty, n.: Being comfortable that others will discover your greatness.
-->

> *"Any intelligent fool can make things bigger, more complex, and more violent. It takes a touch of genius, and a lot of courage, to move in the opposite direction."  
-- Ernst F. Schumacher*

Talent is fragile and it’s the most sensitive envy trigger.

Intelligence is a spectrum, a dog is intelligent also. To reveal the true nature of your intelligence rarely pays.

> *"I think we have an ideology about talent that says that talent is a tangible, resilient, hardened, shiny thing. It will always rise to the top. To find and encourage talent, all you have to do as a society, is to make sure the right doors are open. Free campus visits, free tuition, letters to the kids with high score. You raise your hand and say, «over here!» and the talent will come running, but that’s not true. It’s not resilient and shiny, talent is really, really fragile."  
-- Malcolm Gladwell*

> *"The true test of intelligence is not how much we know how to do, but how to behave when we don’t know what to do."  
-- John Holt*

> *"The real test of intelligence is if you get what you want from life."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The measure of intelligence is the ability to change."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"The difference beteween sounding smart and being smart is «I don't know»."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Clear thinker is a better compliment than smart."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On geniality

<!--
> *"If a man knows more than others he becomes lonely."  
-- Carl Jung*
-->

> *"In every work of genius we recognize our own rejected thoughts; they come back to us with a certain alienated majesty."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

> *"Talent hits a target no one else can hit. Genius hits a target no one else can see."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer*

> *"Some people feel the rain. Others just get wet."  
-- Bob Marley*

> *"Most geniuses prosper not by deconstructing intricate complexities but by exploiting unrecognized simplicities."  
-- Andy Benoit*

> *"Recipe for genius into one sentence: to have a disinterested obsession with something that matters."  
-- Paul Graham*

> *"We like to believe in genius. It gives us an excuse for being lazy."  
-- Paul Graham*

> *"The problem with genius is that you have to tolerate madness."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Andy Warhol is the only genius I’ve ever known with an IQ of 60."  
-- Gore Vidal*

> *"It is the mark of a genious to explain a complex concept in a simple way."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Genious is man who can do the average thing when everyone else around him is losing his mind."  
-- Naval Ravikant*






---
## On wealth

<!--
> *"No one is as impressed with your possessions as you are."  
-- Kevin Kelly*
> *"No one can predict macro."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"Being rich is having money; being wealthy is having time."  
-- Stephen Swidr*
> *"Management is the oldest, and most over-rated form of leverage. Capital, media, and code are the modern forms."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"Making money is not something that you do - it's a skill that you learn."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

- money doesnt buy happiness. it buys freedom.
- you don't get rich by spending your time to save money. you get rich by saving your time to save make money.
- making money is not about luck
- rich people stay rich by living like they're broke. broke people stay broke by living like they're rich
-->

> *"To be wealthy, accumulate all those things that money can’t buy."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Being rich is being fulfilled.

> *"Some people are so poor, all they have is money."  
-- Patrick Meagher*

> *"You’re not supposed to optimize for money; you’re supposed to optimize for happiness."  
-- Mr. Money Mustache*

### On money

<!--
> *"Money follows execution, not precedes it."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
-->

Money is a tool. It can be a force multiplier to help you live the life of your dreams but the perpetual chase for more is not the path that leads to freedom and happiness.

> *"A problem that can be solved with money is not really a problem."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"We don’t make movies to make money; We make money to make more movies."  
-- Walt Disney*

> *"It’s nice to have a lot of money, but you know, you don’t want to keep it around forever. I prefer buying things. Otherwise, it’s a little like saving sex for your old age."  
-- Warren Buffett*

> *"Don’t think money does everything or you are going to end up doing everything for money."  
-- Voltaire*

> *"After a certain point, money is meaningless. It ceases to be the goal. The game is what counts."  
-- Aristotle Onassis*

### How to get wealthy (without getting lucky)

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.  
- Arm yourself with specific knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specific knowledge is knowledge that you cannot be trained for. If society can train you, it can train someone else, and replace you. Specific knowledge is found by pursuing your genuine curiosity and passion rather than whatever is hot right now. Building specific knowledge will feel like play to you but will look like work to others. When specific knowledge is taught, it’s through apprenticeships, not schools. Specific knowledge is often highly technical or creative. It cannot be outsourced or automated.  
- Embrace accountability, and take business risks under your own name. Society will reward you with responsibility, equity, and leverage. The most accountable people have singular, public, and risky brands: Oprah, Trump, Kanye, Elon.  
- Pick business partners with high intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Don’t partner with cynics and pessimists. Their beliefs are self-fulfilling. 
- You will get rich by giving society what it wants but does not yet know how to get. At scale. Pick an industry where you can play long term games with long term people. The Internet has massively broadened the possible space of careers. Most people haven’t figured this out yet. Play iterated games. All the returns in life, whether in wealth, relationships, or knowledge, come from compound interest. Money is inherently neutral. It’s merely a vessel for the exchange of experience between two people. You make your money by creating experiences for others.  
- You’re not going to get rich renting out your time. You must own equity - a piece of a business - to gain your financial freedom.
- Seek wealth, not money or status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your place in the social hierarchy. Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. Ignore people playing status games. They gain status by attacking people playing wealth creation games. Money is not the cause of wealth in one’s life. It is the effect. Similarly, when people assume that money is the cause of their problems, they are actually mistaken. Money is usually the most noticeable effect of their problems. Money is a touchy subject. That’s because most of us, to a certain degree, associate a lot of our self-worth and identity to our job and how much money we make. It is, quite literally, a market valuation of our skills and competence as a person.  
- When you’re finally wealthy, you'll realize that it wasn’t what you were seeking in the first place.

> *"You spend the first 20 years of being rich accumulating all of this stuff. And then you’ll spend the next 20 years trying to get out of one thing after another to simplify your life."  
-- Peter Mallouk*

> *"To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### Nearly free stuff

Books, friends, sleep, stopping bad habits, ideas, gratefulness, laugh, notice, questions.






---
## On popularity

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."  
-- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.

> *"You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The reward for getting on the stage is fame. The price of fame is that you can't get off stage."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"If you're not ready to be hated, you're not ready to be famous."  
-- Naval Ravikant*






---
## On luck and risk

<!--
> *"Live life as if everything is rigged in your favor."  
-- Rumi*
> *"Nothing in the world is ever completely wrong. Even a stopped clock is right twice a day."  
-- Paulo Coelho*
> *"I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi."  
-- M. Vázquez Montalban*
> *"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."  
-- Seneca*
> *"The devil always takes back his gifts."  
-- Ukrainian Proverb*
> *"If there's no wind, row."  
-- Latin Proverb*

- threats x vulnerabilities = risk
- random é a bruxaria - proporçoes random - patterns. everything is a pattern. no pattern is random
-->

> *"Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

Unless you’re winning, life will seem unfair to you. Bad luck is often bad planning. If you’re sure it’s not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually. There’s no magic in the world, it’s all math. The best things in life are born from coincidence.

«Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge. «Surprises» only happen when they didn't repeat on one's lifetime.

> *"If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve."  
-- Charlie Munger*

> *"Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"God is subtle but he is not malicious."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"Coincidence is God’s way of remaining anonymous."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"What do you want to know about investing that we can't know? The exact role of luck in successful outcomes."  
-- Robert Schiller* 

### On risk and chance

Risk is everything you left over and didn't thought about. Luck and risk are two faces of the same coin.

Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

> *"Things that come with little help of luck are more resistant to randomness. People who look too close to randomness burn out. The only article lady fortuna has no control over is your behaviour. Good luck."  
-- Nassim Taleb*






---
## On beauty and style

> *"If cats looked like frogs we'd realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember."  
-- Terry Pratchett*

A beautiful person always see beauty in others.

> *"A man’s face is his autobiography. A woman’s face is her work of fiction."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman."  
-- Coco Chanel*

> *"Elegance is a physical quality. If a woman doesn't have it naked, she'll never have it clothed."  
-- Karl Lagerfeld*

> *"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society."  
-- Mark Twain*

<!--
> *"Many complain of their looks but none of their brains."  
-- Yiddish Proverb*

- dress like you're going somewhere better later
- taste may be an instinct for honest signals
- beauty grabs attention. personality grabs the heart.
-->






---
## On health

> *"You weren’t made to spend 10 hours a day staring at a screen in a cubicle arguing over email. If you do this your body will fall apart. As your body falls apart so will your brain. As your brain goes so does your chances of success or happiness."  
-- Allen Tucker'*

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

### How to stay healthy?

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training = flexibility (yoga or animal movements) + strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.  
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting.  
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated. Sleep deprivation is bad for memory. Stress also.

> *"You can eat any dessert you want if you take only 3 bites."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison."  
-- Ann Wigmore*






---
## On lifestyle

<!--
> *"Hard work is simply the refuge of people that have nothing to do."  
-- Oscar Wilde*
> *"The happiest of all lives is a busy solitude."  
-- Voltaire*
> *"Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination."  
-- Christina Scalise*
> *"The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it."  
-- Henry David Thoreau*
> *"Think of each day as a single life."  
-- Seneca*
> *"He who buys what he does not need, steals from himself."  
-- Swedish Proverb*
> *"If a little is not enough for you, nothing is."  
-- Epicurus*
> *"When working, surround yourself with people more successful than you. When playing, surround yourself with people more happy than you."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"People who live far below their means enjoy a freedom that people busy upgrading their lifestyles can't fathom."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"No routine. I'm famously unscheduled."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"For a great payoff, be especially curious about the things you are not interested in."  
-- Kevin Kelly*
> *"To measure your quality of life, simply do nothing and see how it feels."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"You should be too busy to do coffee, while still keeping an uncluttered calendar."  
-- Naval Ravikant*
> *"Enough is a decision, not an amount."  
-- Alison Faulkner*
> *"Develop strategic incompetence - people won't ask you to do things you hate to do if you're bad at them."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

- 3 hobbies: one cretive, one to keep in shape and one to make money
- we drink to loosen our tongues.
- if you don't love it or use it is clutter.
- all that clutter used to be money.
- decluttering is self-care
- minimalism doesn't avoid possession. only excess.
- the less you own, the less owns you.
- income doesn't make you rich. spending habits do.
- owning less is better than organizing more. eliminate instead of organizing.
- clutter is not just physical stuff. it's old ideas, toxic relationships and bad habits. clutter is everything that doesn't support the better self.
- storage is a way of warehousing the past.
- buy supplies before you need them. gadgets after you need them. three is two. two is one. One is none.
- organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling.
- avoid clothing that's more interesting than you are.
- you cant preach minimalism to whom didnt have too much stuff!
- If you’re not trying to make money, what are you even doing?
- feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
- I'm not choosing ignorance. I'm choosing to not watch wrestling.
- My life has been a series of questions and odd experiments.
- you can never be over dressed or over educated
- being able to sit in forest shortly after waking is the closest thing to heaven on earth.
- technology is my slave, not my master.
- what’s your adrenaline type. ex. adrenalina velocidade vs adrenalina de estar na fronteira do conhecido
- all that clutter used to be money.

> *"At a restaurant do you order what you know is great, or do you try something new? Do you make what you know will sell or try something new? Do you keep dating new folks or try to commit to someone you already met? The optimal balance for exploring new things vs exploiting them once found is: 1/3. Spend 1/3 of your time on exploring and 2/3 time on deepening. It is harder to devote time to exploring as you age because it seems unproductive, but aim for 1/3."  
-- Kevin Kelly*
-->

> *"I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life."  
-- David Hockney*

We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die. When life becomes about enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

> *"A human being should be able to change a diaper, plan an invasion, butcher a hog, conn a ship, design a building, write a sonnet, balance accounts, build a wall, set a bone, comfort the dying, take orders, give orders, cooperate, act alone, solve equations, analyze a new problem, pitch manure, program a computer, cook a tasty meal, fight efficiently, die gallantly. Specialization is for insects."  
-- Robert Heinlein*

> *"Each of us, when our day’s work is done, must seek our ideal, whether it be love or pinochle or lobster à la Newburg, or the sweet silence of the musty bookshelves."  
-- O. Henry*

> *"Spend extravagantly on the things that you love and cut costs mercilessly on the things you don’t."  
-- Ramit Sethi*

> *"Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"I went to collect the few personal belongings which I held to be invaluable: my cat, my resolve to travel, and my solitude."  
-- Colette*

### On travel

> *"Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain."  
-- Jack Kerouac*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.  
- For how long? Research says aim for 3 to 6 days of travel. Frequency beats intensity. 
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with “lifers”: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

> *"What gives value to travel is fear."  
-- Albert Camus*

> *"A vacation + a disaster = an adventure."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"A vacation is a very expensive way to schedule the time to read a book in peace."

-->

> *"Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it."  
-- Marva Collins*

Success = education + massive action

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period. Succeeding means securing advantage.

Success (and happiness) is internal not external. True fulfillment comes from living not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material. When people finally became a “success” they realize that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100,000 in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them.

> *"Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming."  
-- John Woode*

> *"A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do."*

> *"To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man."  
-- Louis L'amour*

> *"Most overnight successes take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Show up. Keep showing up. Somebody successful said: 99% of success is just showing up."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"The success formula: solve your own problems and freely share the solutions."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Recipe for success: under-promise and over-deliver."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### On barriers to success

Fear, not failure, is the biggest barrier to success. Some people are terrified of success, they may be forced to buy a suit.

> *"Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will."*

> *"Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right."  
-- Henry Ford*

> *"If you didn’t get what do you want, it’s a sign that you didn’t really wanted it or you bargained the price."  
-- Roger Kipling*

What’s the dog for? The dog keeps the man from touching any of the machines."

## On humanness and irrationality

> *"If a man gets lost in the mountains, hundreds will search and often two or three searchers are killed. But the next time somebody gets lost, just as many volunteers turn out. Poor arithmetic, but very human. It runs through all our folklore, all human religions, all our literature—a racial conviction that when one human needs rescue, others should not count the price. Weakness? It might be the unique strength that wins us a Galaxy."  
-- Robert Heinlein*

Most people approach each and every year in the exact same way while expecting drastically different results.

> *"How to write compelling characters? It’s easy, just make them contradictions. To be human is to be a contradiction."*

-- Neil Gaiman*

- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.”

-- William Blake*

Don't settle for a place where you're tolerated. Go where you're celebrated.

Keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be. Resist the temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee.

> *"Each time you reach out to people, bring them a blessing; then they’ll be happy to see you when you bring them a problem."

### How to build your «board of directors»?

Curate somehow those who surround you: you are the average of them. If you’re always the smartest in the room, you’re in the wrong room. When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.

<!--
“You only have one life experience. You can only see things one way. No matter how hard you try, you’ve only got one filter and one life experience by which to determine. But when you surround yourself with people that don’t have anything to gain or lose -- non-biased people -- they have different life experiences. They have different filters. They can say, ‘You know what? I’ve done that before and life teaches me this.’
-->

Hints:

- Surround yourself with people who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform. If you spend the majority of your time in worlds where people are accomplishing incredible things, all of a sudden that starts to seem normal. I can maybe look foolish or silly in that group, but it protects me from looking silly and foolish out in the world.
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are.
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
we choose friends by proximity, not how do we feel around them, is him as invested in my well being than i am in his. focus in others people sucess but pick the right people.
- You’re never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you. Second step is inviting them to do something. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. You know someone is a friend when you can go long stretches without talking and the talk is right where we left off.

> *"Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Warriors and worriers. Human males form cooperative groups to compete against out-groups, while human females exclude other females in their quest to find mates, female family members to invest in their children.

-- Joyce Benenson*

- i always have this fear that one day you are going to discover that i'm not as f«great as you once thoght i was.
- once you start disliking someone, everything they do is irritating to you.
- Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently.

- making something social destroys truth of it because social groups need consensus to survive - otherwise they fight and can't get along - and consensus is all about truth seeking.

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it's a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .
3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.
4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.
7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.
8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.
9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.
10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.
11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.
12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.
13. Design is based on requirements. There's no justification for designing something one bit "better" than the requirements dictate.
16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.
17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.
20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.
23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.
27. (Varsi's Law) Schedules only move in one direction.
29. (von Tiesenhausen's Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.
30. (von Tiesenhausen's Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist's concept.

-- Pablo Picasso*

> *"Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do."

Art is a meditation and design is a negotiation. Art is just another form of screaming, it should confort thedisturbed and disturb the confortable. Life imitates art.

Artistic death is made by consensus.

Hints:
- ultimately is about the total cost of the mortgage. that is teh price of teh home. the closing price is an illusion.
- Modern slaves are not chains, they are in debt.
- you're spending time to save money when you should be spending money to save time.
- inflatios = printing money.
- Stock buybacks are effectively same as dividends.
- entrepreneurship vs investment - 2 different mentalities.
- auctions ao contrario! vendo por 40mil. o q venderes dai para cima 50% é para ti!
- analise fundamental e técnica no poker como nas accoes. spectrum entre dois opostos. Crashes are typical of complex systems.

> *"I succeeded because I have a long attention span. (...) Waiting helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can’t stand to wait."  
-- Charlie Munger*

The secret to get healthy finances is not to make more money but to keep it.

Hints:

- Spend less than you make. Saving 10% of all paychecks is a good start.
- Stay liquid, never invest in anything you can’t sell in a month or two. 
- Barbell strategy. Diversify with uncorrelated investment bets.

> *"Never lose money. Rule No. 2: don’t forget rule No. 1."  
-- Warren Buffett*

### On your investment comfort zone

Scared money never wins. It’s all about the risk of losing money versus the risk of missing opportunity. 

> *"The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket."  
-- Kin Hubbard*

> *"When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits."  
-- Warren Buffett*

### How to spot good investments?

> *"It’s not what you buy. It’s what you pay. There is no asset which is so good that it can’t be overpriced and very few assets which are so bad that they can’t be underpriced. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism."  
-- Howard Marks*

Don’t buy on future hopes; buy on past mistakes. We don't loose money on star businesses, we loose money on businesses we think will be star businesses.

Understand:

- What’s going to stay the same in the next ten years. While boring, offer the best investment opportunities.
- Where is low optimism. Recessions are caused when a bunch of people lose confidence all at once.
- Who are the buyers, the sellers and their motivations. The best companies aren’t sold, they're bought. Stay away from junk stocks.
- Investments are competing with each other.
- The more you know, the less you need to diversify. Diversification is an hedge against lack of knowledge.
- Take risk from the table whenever possible.

> *"You’re looking for a mispriced gamble."  
-- Charlie Munger*

> *"What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many. You only have to be able to evaluate companies within your circle of competence. The size of that circle is not very important; knowing its boundaries, however, is vital."  
-- Charlie Munger*

> *"What’s my religion? Arbitrage and rents."  
-- EF*

> *"Every increase in the real wealth of the society, every increase in the quantity of useful labour employed within it, tends indirectly to raise the real rent of land."

## On education

<!--
> *"Learning is a treasure that will follow it's owner everywhere."  
-- Chinese proverb
-->

> *"It's a universal law. Intolerance is teh first sign of an inadequate education. An ill-educated person behaves with arrogant impatience, whereas truly profound education breeds humility."  
-- Alexander Solzhenitsyn*

> *"The purpose of high education is first and foremost to meet people and build relationships."  
-- my teacher*

> *"Education is kindling a flame, not the filling of a vessel."  
-- Socrates*

Education leads toward a continuing self-discovery; training leads toward a final self-definition. School rewards generalists, the world not so.

A college education may help you make a living. Self-education may make you a fortune. The value of formal education is signaling, rather than actual learning.

> *"Self education is, I firmly believe, the only kind of education there is. The only function of a school is to make self education easier; failing that, it does nothing."  
-- Isaac Asimov*

> *"If you need a degree to do it, it's not going to make you wealthy."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"«I want to have a safety net so I can get a job.» This is what my daughter said to me. Where did she learn the phrase “Safety net”?
Maybe the thing about college is that a child is not yet ready to be an adult. It’s the last time they will ever hang out with people their own age. My closest friends are not my age. In college though, they were. It’s scary to be an adult. To survive. It’s a jungle. College is still a walled safe city for kids just like you. I would pay a lot to be a child again. To not make the mistakes of adulthood. To not have those fears. So maybe that’s what the college tuition is. The cost to extend childhood. And the cost of childhood is going up."  
-- James Altucher*

> *"Education: the path from cocky ignorance to miserable uncertainty."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"The overeducated are worse off than the undereducated, having traded common sense for the illusion of knowledge. (...) The modern conceit - educated people think they can outsmart complex systems like evolution, capitalism, weather and biology."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Learning is cheap, education is expensive."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Given that the main funcion of universities these days is filtering and signaling, the best move is to get admitted to Stanford and then drop out."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Education is what survives when what has been learnt has been forgotten."  
-- B.F. Skinner*

Study physics, mathematics, computers, microeconomics, game theory and persuasion.

> *"The strongest intellectual foundation is built upon science, math and philosophy, as they are the search for universal truths."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The ideal school would teach health, wealth and happiness. It would be self-paced and available to all. It would show opposing ideas and students would self-verify truth. No grades, no tests, no diplomas - just learning. Actually you're already here. Careful who you follow."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

## On reading

> *"I cannot remember the books I have read any more than the meals I have eaten; even so, they have made me."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

Reading train your model of the world. Even if you forget most, its effect persists.

> *"A book is less important for what it says than for what it makes you think."  
-- Louis L'amour*

-- Matt Haig*

> *"Books serve to show a man that those original thoughts of his aren’t very new after all."  
-- Abraham Lincoln*

> *"Books are like mirrors: if a fool looks in, you cannot expect a genius to look out."  
-- J.K. Rowling*

> *"Books say: she did this because. Life says: she did this. Books are where things are explained to you; life is where things aren’t. I'm not surprised some people prefer books."  
-- Julian Barnes*

> *"A library is infinity under a roof."  
-- Gail Carson Levine*

> *"Think before you speak. Read before you think."  
-- Fran Lebowitz*

> *"No book is worth reading that isn’t worth rereading."  
-- Susan Sontag*

> *"One cannot read a book: one can only reread it. A good reader, a major reader, an active and creative reader is a rereader."  
-- Nabokov*

> *"I have never met a person I admired who did not read more books than I did."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"You don’t have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them."  
-- Ray Bradbury*

### On classics

Don't read the books made to make money, read the ones they want to ban. Most books are propaganda.

> *"The great books are the books that never have to be written again."  
-- Carl Van Doren*

> *"A classic is a book which people praise and don’t read."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"The worst thing about new books is that they keep us from reading the old ones."  
-- Joseph Joubert*

> *"When the reader is ready the book appears."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

-- Walter *Lippmann*
> *"I have made this letter longer then usual because I lacked the time to make it shorter."  
-- Blaise Pascal (?)*
> *"The purpose of literature is to turn blood into ink."  
-- T.S.Eliot*
> *"Write drunk. Edir sober."  
-- Ernest Hemingway*
> *"I write because I don't know what I think until I read what I say."  
-- Flannery O'Connor*
> *"A good speech should be like a woman's skirt: long enough to cover the subject ans short enought o create interest."  
-- Winston Churchill*
> *"The biggest lie we tell ourselves is «I dont need to write this down because I will remember it.»"
-- Kevin Kelly*
> *"I try not to speak more clearly than I think."  
-- Niels Bohr*

- o poeta faz a sintese das coisas
> *"The media is always accurate, except when they are talking about things I know.*
> *"Eloquence is logic on fire.*
-->

> *"Tears are words that need to be written."  
-- Paulo Coelho*

> *"I write to give myself strength. I write to be the characters that I am not. I write to explore all the things I’m afraid of."  
-- Joss Whedon*

If you are writing to be read you are doing it wrongly. Write to learn not to teach. If you have lived a diverse life you'll have a lot to say.

> *"The best writing is rewriting."  
-- E. B. White*

> *"Any word you have to hunt for in a thesaurus is the wrong word."  
-- Stephen King*

> *"There are no more writers like Shakespeare because all he had was a table, a candle, a pen and some paper."  
-- Chris Cornell*

> *"The pen is the tongue of the mind."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes*

> *"This sentence has five words. Here are five more words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become monotonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It’s like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes, when I am certain the reader is rested, I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals–sounds that say listen to this, it is important.  
So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader’s ear. Don’t just write words. Write music"  
-- Gary Provost*

### On email

<!--
> *"Troublesome correspondence that is postponed long enough will eventually become irrelevant."  
-- Mark Albrecht*
-->

Hints:

- Make the subject unique, meaningful and easily searchable.  
- Make a single, specific, simple request – such that it’s hard to say no - in the first line and then explain if you need to. The reader should be able to reply to the email in one word, forward it on to the right person or delete it so be specific in your request. Examples:
	- «Do you have time for a 5 min call this week?»  
	- «Can you meet Wed, Sept 10 in XYZ location between 10 am and 12 pm?» instead of «Can you meet sometime next week?»
	- «Please review and sign this document.»  
	- «Can you make a quick intro to XYZ person?» 
	- «I’d love a letter of support from you. I’ve attached a draft for your review.»  
- Keep it under three lines, more than this call.  
- Use easy-to-read formatting. Font 12/14, bold, underline and ALL CAPS for the MAIN QUESTION, IMPORTANT DATES, and other KEY DETAILS.

## On media

> *"The goal of media is to make every problem, your problem."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

News are the first draft of History but he human brain was not designed to process all of the world's emergencies in realtime. Journalism is now activism. It's the only way to get eyeballs. Media companies harvest your attention and transform it into revenue. 

> *"Journalists aren't neutral, they're the cavalry of culture wars."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"The more people in the conversation the harder it becomes to speak the unconfortable truth. Social media puts everybody in the same conversation."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"If you're writing for your followers, your followers are worthless."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

## On computers and maths

<!--
> *"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."  
-- Pablo Picasso*

- hash is a fingerprint of an amount of information. SHA256 -> 64 characters
- Anytime machine learning is working quietly in the background, it almost always shows up as a feed in the front-end design
- 90% of webapps are database frontends.
- a fundamental rule of technology: There is no third ecosystem
- Top dev skills: Ability to ignore new tools and technologies; Taste for simplicity; Good code deletion skills; Humility.
alan perlis - 1. One man's constant is another man's variable.
alan perlis - 21. Optimization hinders evolution.
alan perlis - 58. Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
alan perlis - 63. When we write programs that "learn", it turns out that we do and they don't.
alan perlis - 105. You can't communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.
alan perlis - 120. Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new machines to behave like old ones.

> *"We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins."  
-- Ellen Ullman*

We’ve grown dependent on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.

-- Albert Einstein*

> *"Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost. Rigor should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere."  
-- William S. Anglin*

> *"If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is."  
-- John von Neumann*
