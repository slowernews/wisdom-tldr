### On memory

> *"Memory is never a precise duplicate of the original; instead, it is a continuing act of creation."  
-- Rosalind Cartwright [1922]*

You are your memory.

However you can’t start a new chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one. The past may be a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay. Let go your past failures. They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future. Don’t be a prisoner of your past, it was just a lesson not a life sentence. The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality. Who are you becoming is more important than who you have been.

## On present

<!--
- Think in years, work in days, live in the moment.
- «4000 weeks» is by far the most insane framing for how short life is. “80 summers” is easily the most insane way to describe how short life is. | 96 blocks a day -- wait but why

> *"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."  
-- Steve Jobs [1955]*

You will die soon.

Act accordingly and don’t postpone joy. Live life like it’s everyone else’s last day. If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, you won’t find it anywhere. Just because you are not where you want to be, doesn’t mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment.

The elderly and dying invariably regret what they didn’t do, not what they did.

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On future

> *"The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits."  
-- Michelangelo [1475]*

Dream big.

An ambitious goal sets the bar so high that even a failure can be considered a success by ordinary standards. If your dreams don’t frighten you, they are not big enough.

Our present (in)actions will compound into the future we will experience – that’s a great way to think about what lies ahead. However, don’t worry, you can’t control much.

Futurism is a study of time. Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.
