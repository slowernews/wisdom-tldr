The root cause of most health problems is often not physical but mental.

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

### On depression and anxiety

<!--
- The more alone a man is, the more likely he is to get into "depression". Live alone, eat alone, work alone, never go out = depression. Spend more time with people, go out in nature, lift weights, and eat good food - no depression.
- the only thing complaining does is convince other people that you are not in control.
- we don’t have anxiety for things we think we can handle!
- you can’t heal if you keep pretending you’re not hurt.
- You know a nigga depressed once he starts going on walks.
- having to go to school on your birthday and everyone pointing it out.
- can i ask you a question? 99% people get frightened.
-->

> *"If you are depressed you are living in the past.  
If you are anxious you are living in the future.   
If you are at peace you are living in the present."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

The heaviest burdens that we carry are the thoughts in our heads.

Depression and anxiety are symptoms of under-stimulation and over-stimulation, not diseases:

- Depression (under-stimulation) can be viewed as a lack of self-expression. It may arise when one feels powerless or dominated, leading to chronic stress as a way to stimulate oneself.
- Anxiety (over-stimulation) manifests as hypersensitivity and can be linked to our evolutionary need for control. Anxiety isn’t productive planning; it’s a continuous state of apprehension over various scenarios. Worrying about the unknown is unproductive; we have limited control and primarily influence rather than dictate outcomes. Stress often results from excessive concern, and worrying is a misuse of the imagination. The past exists only in your thoughts; what truly matters is the present and the future.

Hints:

- Stress is who you think you should be. Peace is who you are. As I began to love myself, my relationship with everyone changed.
- Financial health is just as important as physical health. Nothing feels as good as having a «fuck you» fund.
- Therapy (awareness of past) / Spirituality (awareness of present) / Yoga (awareness of future)
- The philosopher Alain de Botton has written about this in his book Status Anxiety. In centuries past, he says, people knew where they fit into the social order. If you were born a peasant, you knew you were a peasant. If you were born a lord, you knew you were a lord. There was no mobility or opportunity, and so there was no stress about getting ahead. You weren’t responsible for your birthright, so you accepted it and moved on. But in a meritocratic society, something changes. In a meritocracy, if you’re poor, or you gain success and then lose it, it’s not an accident. It’s worse. It’s your fault. You’re the failure. You’re the one who lost everything. And this causes people to live shackled with a constant fear of inadequacy; all the world’s hustle and bustle motivated by a baseline status anxiety. De Botton doesn’t argue that feudal societies or poor societies were somehow better. He simply makes the point that when a society goes from feudal and destitute to meritocratic and wealthy, the price its people pay for that increased standard of living and social mobility is an increase in stress and anxiety.
- Anxious persons feel the only way to achieve relaxed certainty is getting new info but the more you know the more you’ll realize you don’t know.
- Avoiding anxiety leads to more anxiety. While we’re busy trying to avoid the feeling of anxiety, we begin to restrict our life more and more.
- Thinking about it makes it worse. Writing about it makes it better.
- Burnout is an oversaturation of the sameness.
- No purpose attracts depression. Unemployment makes you unhappy. Dot.
- Anything beyond what we need is poison. it can be power, laziness, food, ego, ambition, vanity, fear, anger, or whatever.
- Cages aren’t made of iron, they’re made of thoughts. The hardest prison to escape is in your own mind. Depression hates a moving target.
- A sedentary lifestyle is a magnet for depression. Seeds of doubt grow into forests of inaction. It took me years to realize that the only cure to depression is just leaving the house at every single possible opportunity no matter how badly you don’t want to.
- Turns out I wasn’t depressed, I just needed a job that fulfills me, a «date to marry» relationship, a consistent physical activity and high protein whole foods nutrition.
- Worrying is worshipping the problem. If you panic, panic early.

### How to stay healthy?

> *"Calm the stomach. Move the body. Rest the mind."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Action cures everything. There’s nothing more therapeutic than action. Physical stress eliminates the need for control.

We were built to hunt, gather, and move, not to stay still.

Hints:

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training is training flexibility (yoga or animal movements) and strength (weights). Minimum effective dose. Burn extra calories to reduce the need for control. When you’re feeling stressed out, take a moment to breathe. Remember that body language affects your psychology, mood, and even hormonal balance. People tend to be naturally happier when they’re kept busy. Exercise is a celebration of what your body can do not a punishment for what you ate.  
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting. *Debug* your body as much as you can.  
- The best antidepressant is knowing that we matter to others. People don’t die from suicide; they die from sadness.  
- Hustling (the right amount of stimulation) involves consistently stretching your comfort zone. Avoiding stress is avoiding life.
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated.

## On fear and courage

<!--
> *"Train yourself to let go of everything you fear to lose."  -- Yoda*
> *"He who jumps into the void owes no explanation to those who stand and watch."
+ x@naval -- Because, as Taleb says, courage is the only virtue that can’t be faked.

- bravery is learned -> micro-bravery, start small
- What would you do if you weren’t afraid?
- dishonesty is a reaction to fear. fear just wants us to stay the same.
- climbing out the hole is about letting go of pride.
-->

> *"We fear things in proportion to our ignorance of them."  
-- Christian Nestell Bovee [1820]*

Fear is paralyzing. Fear does not stop death, it stops life.

When you view everything through the lens of fear, you’re more likely to remain in retreat mode. Anger and excuses often mask underlying fears. Remember that all excuses can be challenged. The best years of your life are the ones in which you take ownership of your problems rather than blaming them on your family, the environment, or the president. Living in reality requires less energy than cultivating a victim mentality. Escaping reality drains your energy. What are we afraid of? We’re afraid of growth. We’re terrified of exposure. Remember, nothing scares the crap out of us more than advancing, because to advance is to move from the known to the unknown. fear that you are not good enough: that you will never find a woman as good as your current girlfriend, or that other men will be able to care for her and satisfy her better than you will.

A coward has no scar.

Heros and cowards feel the same fear but their answers are different. Courage implies low reverence. Courage is a form of intelligence not strenght. It’s about outwitting your limiting beliefs, irrational fears and insecurities.

Hints:

- Replace fear with curiosity. Conquering fear means defining fear. Fear makes the wolf bigger than he really is.

## On limits

> *"We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training."  
-- Archilochus [-680]*

The fears you don’t face become your limits.

Nothing can sabotage you more quickly and more completely than limiting beliefs. People underestimate their possibilities. However your level of success will seldom exceed your level of personal development.

## On failure

> *"Experience is merely the name men gave to their mistakes."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

Sometimes you win, sometimes you learn. Fail fast and bounce back quickly.

A failure is a man who has blundered but is not capable of cashing in on the experience. Failure is only failure if you don’t learn from it. Accept it as part of the process. Repeated failure will toughen your spirit and show you with absolute clarity how things must be done. Anyone who has never made a mistake has never tried anything new. When you don’t know something you will pay for it - that’s the stupidity tax. We should fear missing opportunity more than we should fear failure.

Smart people aren’t used to failing, so they struggle to learn from their mistakes and often respond by blaming someone else.

> *"Our greatest glory is not in never falling, but in rising every time we fall."  
-- Confucius [-551]*

> *"All men make mistakes, but a good man yields when he knows his course is wrong, and repairs the evil. The only crime is pride."

-- Brandi Chastain [1968]*

### On scars and wounds

> *"A scar is not an injury. A scar is an healing. After an injury, a scar is what makes you whole."  
-- China Mieville [1972]*

Don’t punish yourself for failing. Failing is learning.

You are more than your mistakes. Past mistakes are meant to guide you, not to define you. If you don’t heal what hurt you, you’ll bleed on people who didn’t cut you. Don’t hide your scars. They are proof that you showed up for life. And fought. 

> *"The scars you acquire by exercising courage will never make you feel inferior."  
-- Cima da Conegliano [1459]*

> *"Adversity makes men, and prosperity makes monsters."  
-- Victor Hugo [1802]*

> *"Your pain, is the breaking of the shell that encloses your understanding." (...)  
"Out of suffering have emerged the strongest souls; the most massive characters are seared with scars."  
-- Kahlil Gibran [1883]*

> *"Sorrow is better than fear. Fear is a journey, a terrible journey. But, sorrow is at least an arriving."  
-- Alan Paton [1903]*

> *"Someone I loved once gave me a box full of darkness. It took me years to understand that this too, was a gift."  
-- Mary Oliver [1935]*

> *"Words can’t hurt you, they can only hurt your image of you."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### On anger

> *"The more you know who you are, and what you want, the less you let things upset you."  
-- Bob Harris (fictional)*

Anger is a punishment we give ourselves for someone else’s mistake. We are wired to blame: we blame ourselves or the others. We are obsessed with fault.

Most angry people are envious people who don’t understand that life will only get better once they are focused on their own lives and actively improving who they are. Someone complaining a lot is someone not accomplishing a lot. Pay attention to what people say out of anger, they’ve been dying to tell you that.

> *"In anger we should refrain both from speech and action."  
-- Pythagoras [-570]*

> *"An angry man opens his mouth and shuts his eyes."  
-- Cato the Younger [-095]*

> *"Any person capable of angering you becomes your master; he can anger you only you permit yourself being disturbed by him."  
-- Epictetus [0050]*

> *"And God said «love your enemy», and I loved myself."  
-- Kahlil Gibran [1883]*






## On shame, confidence and validation

> *"Shame corrodes the very part of us that believes we are capable of change."  
-- Brené Brown [1965]*

You are not what you think you are: you are what you hide.

The things you hate most about yourself are the things you hide from the rest of the world. Trauma is a tattoo on the soul. Tattoos and body piercings compensate insecurities. I’ve never met anyone yet covered in tattoos who isn’t profoundly insecure. 

You cannot live when you are untouchable. Life is vulnerability.

> *"I was ashamed of myself when I realized that life was a costume party; and I attended with my real face."  
-- Franz Kafka [1883]*

> *"The greater the outward show, the greater the inward poverty."  
-- J. Krishnamurti [1895]*

> *"Man is not what he thinks he is, he is what he hides."  
-- Andre Malraux [1901]*

> *"The curious paradox is that when I accept myself just as I am, then I can change."  
-- Carl Rogers [1902]*

> *"Insecurity is the result of trying to be secure."  
-- Alan Watts [1915]*

> *"Guilt is society’s voice speaking in your head."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Smart people are so good at discovering their own flaws but so mid at actually fixing them. Is the solution to most of their problems just experimental drugs or getting a job in sales?"  
-- x@anuatluru*

### On confidence and validation

<!--
- Do what scares you until it doesn’t.
- How you view yourself is how people will view you.
- humble enough to know i’m replaceable. cocky enough to know is a downgrade.
- Normalize this. Normalize that. How about you feel shame for once?
- People with low self-esteem protect themselves by not taking risks. High self-esteem gives you the power of confidence to take chances.
- Confidence in public comes from discipline in private.
- I can see in his eyes whether he’s confident about himself. The more confident a man is, the slower he will talk.
- Real confidence is like an aura, calm assuredness. Fake confidence is loud, annoying and needy.
- If words can hurt you Then you are weak.
- People who lack self-confidence love to make fun of others and denigrate their success, that’s how they feel better about themselves, don’t take it personally.
- you’re so busy doubting yourself while so many others are intimidated by your potential.
-->

> *"Having a low opinion of yourself is not modesty. It’s self-destruction."  
-- Bobbe Sommer [1936]*

Confidence is the opposite of shame. Confidence is shamelessness. 

You don’t have to prove anything to anybody, including yourself. Low confidence is the source of all problems and neediness its marker.

Hints:

- Too many people undervalue what they are and overvalue what they are not. If the universe didn’t need you, you wouldn’t be here. Don’t wait for someone to tell you that you are special. 
- To get self-aceptance you have to do the unconfortable things that you know you are right. When you break an agreement you made with yourself, your self-esteem plummets. It’s really hard to have self-esteem. Everyone wants to take it from you. A boss, a teacher, a parent, a friend, a lover.
- Confidence markers: the space you take up in the world indicates to others and yourself how confident you feel. Presence is confidence without arrogance. Authenticity can’t be faked. The greatest demonstration of power and security is to actually make oneself defenseless, to become as comfortable with one’s weaknesses as possible. When accompanied by authenticity and personal accountability, vulnerability is almost always an extremely attractive behavior. When it’s not attractive, then it signals legitimate incompatibility.
- Believe you can, and you’re halfway there. If you don’t believe you are good, you’ll never be good. If you say it with confidence, you are who you say you are. So you’re only as good as your next speech.
- Confidence is silent. Insecurities are loud.
- get confidence: impress yourself
- Not being insecure about an unattractive quality instantly makes you way more attractive. Generally the thing you’re most ashamed of is actually your biggest strenght/asset but you haven’t figured out how to use it.
- Self-worth is how you feel about the negative aspects of yourself. The people who truly have self-worth don’t think they’re something special.
- Men stop valuing themselves and their own opinions and beliefs and start valuing only the approval and validation of women.
- Rejection is a tool that reveals incompatibility not your inadequateness.
- Confidence come from some success. You need some accomplishment to get there.
- Everything you’re running away is in your head. We hold on to something so tight because we fear something so great won’t happen twice.
- Money problems are self-confidence problems.
- Confident people don’t crave attention.
- You can’t force someone to respect you, but you can refuse to be disrespected. Normalize ghosting people at the first sign of disrespect.
- They don’t respect you at the bottom, they ignore you in the middle, and they hate you at the top. You’ll never have everyone’s approval. So it’s best to just focus on what you’re doing.
- Respect isn’t earned anymore. It’s auctioned to the highest bidder.

### How to overcome shame and grow confidence?

> *"Once you’ve accepted your flaws, no one can use them against you."  
-- Tyrion {fiction}*

Honesty is the pathway to confidence.

When hiding something about yourself, you automatically create shame. You’re saying this thing that’s true about myself is wrong. Speaking openly about an imperfection is a sign of strength, not a weakness. So you gotta share that shit in order to heal it.

### On entitlement and ego

> *"Arrogance is a smokescreen for insecurity."  
-- Amy Cuddy [1972]*

Confidence is not walking into a room thinking you are better than everyone, it’s walking in not having to compare yourself with anyone. Someone else’s strengths don’t make you look bad, being jealous and insecure does. People will tolerate a bit of arrogance if you are talented and still young; but once you get older, you understand that you could have attracted many more opportunities if you had had the intelligence to learn humility earlier in life.

Entitlement comes in two forms:

- I’m better than everybody so I deserve special treatment.  
- I’m worse than everybody so I deserve special treatment.

### On introversion and insecurity

<!--
- Most people are not extremes. Most things are not binary. Introvert is not shyness. Imagine a introvertness scale from 1 to 7. It’s hard to pass from a 2 to 7 but you can pass from 2 to a 3 or 4.
-->

> *"You think you are an introvert because you like being alone. But in reality you just love being in peace. And you’re actually extroverted around people who bring you peace."  
-- x@zacharylaid*

There are no introverts, only people that don’t feel safe.

> *"Intellectualism is a common cover-up for fear of direct experience."  
-- Carl Jung [1875]*

> *"Introverts, being "too nice" is not kindness, it’s a trauma response. Where does this come from? For many, it starts in childhood: Growing up in unpredictable environments; having to please parents to avoid punishment or neglect; believing your worth depends on keeping others happy. This behavior becomes survival."  
-- x@karunpal*

> *"The introvert/extrovert dichotomy has always struck me as a bit silly. People generally gain energy spending time with people they feel they can be their authentic selves around. They generally spend energy being around people they feel they can’t."  
-- x@kaseyklimes*






## On jealousy and envy

<!--
- A inveja mata-nos. O sucesso dá-nos vida!
- Humans hate the most successful humans as it makes their little egos feel inferior.
-->

> *"You’ll never be criticized by someone who is doing more than you. You’ll always be critized by someone who is doing less. Remember that."  
-- Denzel Washington [1954]*

Envy is a sign that you are not focused on your life.

Jealousy is the face of low self-esteem. An healthy mind does not speak ill of others. Outliers inspire envy. Once they stop talking to you, they start talking about you. Intelligence, wealth, fame, luck, beauty, health, sucess and lifestyle (freedom) are the main triggers.

Treat haters like toddlers. When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours. Only take advice from those achieving what you want to achieve. Ignore and be flattered by the rest. Never hate people who are jealous of you. Respect their jealousy - they think that you’re better than them. If someone is copying you, you won. Jealousy comes in jokes, pay attention.

> *"Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people."

### On self awareness

> *"No persons are more frequently wrong, than those who will not admit they are wrong."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld [1613]*

However beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy. When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.

Self awareness is the ability to pause your mind. It reduces the gap between who you are and who you think you are. 

Do you know anyone who doesn’t have any blind spots? So why would you be different?  

Hints:

- Meditation makes you more mindful. Over time, meditation can rewire your brain to be less reactive and enable you to thoughtfully respond to your feelings.
- Ask questions to challenge your assumptions: «What if I’m wrong about this?»

> *"If you correct your mind, the rest of your life will fall into place."

## On pessimism

> *"The pessimist complains about the wind; the optimist expects it to change; the realist adjusts the sails."  
-- William Arthur Ward [1921]*

Pessimism is a scarcity mindset.

Pessimism is seductive. Optimism sounds like a sales pitch, pessimism sounds like someone trying to help you.
While optimism is not always the way, pessimism is rarely the way. On the long term, an optimistic bias may payoff.

Entrepreneurs are inherently optimistic because they are rewarded by being optimistic. Intelectuals the opposite.

> *"Both optimists and pessimists contribute to society. The optimist invents the aeroplane, the pessimist the parachute."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"Keep you thoughts positive because your thoughts become your words. Keep your thoughts positive because your words become your behaviour. Keep your behavior positive because your behavior becomes your habits. Keep your habits positive because your habits becomes your values. Keep your values positive because your values become your destiny."  
-- Mahatma Gandhi [1869]*

> *"I’m always looking for a way to make it happen, not excuses why it won’t work."  
-- Aaron Walker [1910]*

> *"An optimist expects his dreams to come true; a pessimist expects his nightmares to."  
-- Laurence J. Peter [1919]*

> *"That was one of the virtues of being a pessimist: nothing was ever as bad as you thought it would be."  
-- James Jones [1921]*

> *"There’s no difference between a pessimist who says, «Oh, it’s hopeless, so don’t bother doing anything», and an optimist who says, «Don’t bother doing anything, it’s going to turn out fine any way». Either way, nothing happens."  
-- Yvon Chouinard [1934]*

> *"You’ll never meet a very successful pessimistic person. If you want to be remarkable, get better at being optimistic."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Complaints don’t deliver complaints, they mostly reveal your weakness."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Criticism without creativity is just pessimism. The honest way to critique is to create the alternative." (...)  
"To see if they really think that things are getting worse, ask them if they’d rather live in the future or in the past." (...)  
"It’s good to be optimistic in the general and skeptical in the specific. It’s very dangerous to be pessimistic in the general and optimistic in the specific."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Pessimists sound smart. Optimists make money."  
-- Nat Friedman [1977]*

> *"While optimists will sometimes mistake a steaming turd for pure gold, they will not miss a piece of genuine gold when it crosses their path."  
-- Mark Manson [1984]*

> *"A pessimist sees a difficulty in every opportunity. An optimist sees an opportunity in every difficulty."  

-- Bertram Carr*

> *"Optimists are focused on rewards. Pessimists are focused on risks."

## On perfectionism

> *"Perfectionism is the fear of being criticized."  
-- Caroline Myss [1952]*

Strive for excellence, not for perfection. From good enough you derive success. From perfection you derive procrastination, anxiety and depression. It’s liberating to see yourself as a «doist».

> *"There is only one way to avoid criticism: do nothing, say nothing, and be nothing."  
-- Aristotle [-384]*

> *"The perfect is the enemy of the good."

### On procrastination

<!--
- Just finished the book «Buy Back Your Time». Key takeaway? Outsource your weaknesses. It isn’t lazy, it’s smart. Double down on your zone of genius and watch your business, health and life transform.
- One pattern I’ve noticed in all miserable people: They overthink and underact.
-->

> *"One of the counterintuitive things that I’ve learned is that procrastination is often a side-effect of perfectionism."  
-- hn@bane*

We fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all. Inadequacy of results makes us realize that we are not as good as we think we are and creates anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us. We procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety. When hope disappears, so does action. The cost of procrastination is the life you could’ve lived.

Hints:

- What gets measured gets done.
- Don’t wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet. You will languish if you stop for a long time and paralysis is worse than bad timing.
 At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused (the panic monster). 
- However, never mistake action for motion. You must think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought. So make a plan. Any plan will do.
- Procrastination leads to burnout much more than work does.
- You’re too gifted to be paralyzed by procrastination. Dear son, I need you to focus.
- Laziness is often disguised as a lack of knowledge but is just a symptom of not having something worth waking up for. It’s a lack of direction. When your goals align with your passions, laziness fades away because you’re driven by something bigger than yourself. Purpose fuels progress. It’s about building something that outlasts you.

> *"What’s well begun is half done."  
-- Horace [-065]*

> *"Evil is whatever distracts."  
-- Franz Kafka [1883]*

> *"The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it." (...)

### On clutter

> *"Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination."  
-- x@authorcscalise*

Hints:

- Remove unnecessary distractions and obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals. Technology is your slave, not your master. You’re not choosing ignorance, you’re choosing to not watch wrestling.
- Minimalism doesn’t avoid possession. Only excess. The less you own, the less owns you. Owning less is better than organizing more. Eliminate instead of organizing. Organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling. Actively declutter makes room for your true treasures and clarify your values. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need. Storage is a way of warehousing the past. If you don’t love it or use it is clutter. Decluttering is self-care. Clutter is not just physical stuff. It’s old ideas, toxic relationships and bad habits. Clutter is everything that doesn’t support the better self.
- Use it or loose it. A tool is useful when passes human level. Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
- Owning less is better than organising more. Eliminate instead of organize.
- Buy supplies before you need them. Gadgets after you need them. Three is two. Two is one. One is none.
- All that clutter used to be money. Clutter is just a museum of shit you thought would make you happy.

### On addictions

> *"The three most harmful addictions are heroin, carbohydrates, and a monthly sallary."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

Nietzsche describes 3 modern vices: _overwork_ (to be constantly busy is self-negation. It betrays a «will to forget» oneself), _curiosity_ (vague curiosity about everything, without deep obsessions, goes nowhere) and _sympathy_ (sympathy for all means a refusal to rank good and bad).

Hints:

- Signs of a man who has lost control of his life: watch porn, addicted to comfort, addicted to drugs and alcohol. Spend all day indoor.
- Porn isn’t real sex. Cocaine isn’t real energy. Alcohol isn’t real courage. Gambling isn’t real investing. Nightly news isn’t real facts. Social media isn’t really social. Business books aren’t real business.

> *"Addiction to knowledge is like any other addiction. It offers an escape from the fear of emptiness, of loneliness, of frustration, the fear of being nothing."  
-- x@k__quotes*






## On growing old

> *"If you arrive to my age and nobody thinks well of you, I don’t care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

After reaching a certain age, you are no longer seen as an individual; you become an institution and are treated as institutions are. You are expected to behave like a piece of historical furniture, an architectural landmark.

> *"Nothing is more disgraceful than that an old man should have nothing to show to prove that he has lived long, except his years."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

> *"As a well spent day brings happy sleep, so life well used brings happy death."  
-- Leonardo da Vinci [1452]*

> *"My life was sharply divided in two halves. In the first half, I was always the youngest in the group; in the second half, I was always the oldest. There was no transitional period."  
-- Stanisław Ulam [1909]*

> *"When you’re young, you have so much time but never enough money. When you’re old you have money but never enough time."  
-- Jon Boorman [1933]*

### On aging

<!--
- Young people have energy to argue over every minor difference or slight. They possess both the vigour and the inclination to squabble. But with age, and wisdom, you just don’t care. You pick your battles. You assess the value of conflict. If the payoff for winning doesn’t exceed the effort required to win - you simply don’t bother. You neglect. You ignore. You don’t care.
-->

> *"A man that lives from memories becames old. One that lives from projects remains young."  
-- Bruno Munari [1907]*

People my age are so much older than me.

-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"You are only as young as the last time you changed your mind."

Aging implies wear and tear, often seen as a high price to pay for maturity.

> *"Forty is the old age of youth; fifty is the youth of old age."  
-- Victor Hugo [1802]*

> *"When I was younger, I could remember anything, whether it had happened or not; but my faculties are decaying now and soon I shall be so I cannot remember any but the things that never happened. It is sad to go to pieces like this but we all have to do it."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Every day in the mirror I watch death at work."  
-- Jean Cocteau [1889]*

> *"Ain’t nothin’ an old man can do for me but bring me a message from a young man."  
-- Moms Mabley [1894]*

> *"Once I was beautiful, now I’m myself."  
-- Anne Sexton [1928]*

### On maturity

<!--
- Normalize this by age 30: Talk slow. Be clear. Never mumble. Don’t interrupt.
- As you get older, you want to simplify your life: family and friends with no drama, nutritional and exercising habits with no health risk, a neighborhood with no worry about public safety and cleanliness, time online with no anger and outrage. A simple, but better life.
- At twenty, you think you have the whole world figured out, then with every passing year, you become more humble, you stop jumping to conclusions, you stop judging people you actually don’t know.
-->

> *"The foundation of maturity: just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

The advantage of aging is that you become more decisive. Maturing is realizing that many things don’t need your comments. Maturity is when you don’t force people to choose you, when you feel like you have to stop taking care of the world.

### On loneliness

> *"If a man knows more than others he becomes lonely." (...)  
"Loneliness does not come from having no people around you, but from being unable to communicate the things that seem important to you."  
-- Carl Jung [1875]*

A person who is okay with being alone is a powerful person.

> *"A man can be himself only so long as he is alone; and if he does not love solitude, he will not love freedom; for it is only when he is alone that he is really free."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer [1788]*

> *"I hate who teals my solitude without, in exchange, offering me true company."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"If you are afraid of loneliness, don’t marry."  
-- Anton Chekhov [1860]*

> *"Loneliness really haunts me. That’s a theme for the young – not wanting to be alone, not wanting to be older, not wanting to give up their teenage lack of responsibility. They postpone everything in order to find some beauty, which becomes increasingly difficult as you get older."  
-- John Cassavetes [1929]*

### On death

> *"My objective is to die with my shoes on."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

Finding a place to die is an important thing to do.
