## On communication

<!--

> *"A bore is someone who persists in holding his own views after we have enlightened him with ours.*

- A loucura é a incapacidade de comunicar-se.
- you don’t need to have an opinion about everything. get fewer opinions about way fewer things. then interrogate your stronger opinions.
-->

> *"Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens."  
-- Jimi Hendrix*

Speak less and listen more.

> *"People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk*

> *"Know how to listen and you will profit even from those who talk badly."  
-- Plutarch*

> *"A fool is known by his speech, and a wise man by silence."  
-- Pythagoras*

### How to communicate? 

> *"If you want to be interesting, be interested."  
-- David Ogilvy*

Be interested to be interesting. Don’t debate at all. Just listen. The point of a conversation is not to win.

Hints:

- Listen. Mirroring or paraphrase: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question or repeat what they just said in your own words. (Yes, it’s that simple). Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Don’t worry about what you’re going to say next. Speak what’s in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Be interested to be interesting. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..  
- Ask questions. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. No one is boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions. But you must be curious, asking questions without paying attention is worthless. Making good/unusual questions will make people interested in you. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It’s hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but cF\rucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments or asking for advice.
- Stop trying to impress. Focus on being interested instead of being interesting. Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and it will appear as fake. Smile and relax. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people always smile more. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Don’t be stubborn. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don’t judge. Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.
- People believe in everything, if you whisper it.
- Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day.

### How to discord?

> *"Admit when you’re wrong. Shut up when you’re right."  
-- John Gottman*

Listen as you’re wrong. Ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. If they can explain why they are correct, you’ll learn something. If they can’t you’ll soften their views.

> *"Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"With truly logical people, most arguments are very short and based mainly on differing assumptions."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### How to tell good stories?

> *"Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out."  
-- Alfred Hitchcock*

Good stories condense a massive amount of details into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment.

> *"The more you say, the less people remember."  
-- François Fénelon*

### On public speaking

> *"Eloquence is logic on fire."  
-- Lyman Beecher*

> *"The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Hints:

- You don’t need to answer their questions. You can say whatever you want if it’s interesting but learn when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions.
- Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of desagreeing.

> *"A good speech should be like a woman’s skirt: long enough to cover the subject and short enought o create interest."  
-- Winston Churchill*

> *"Always say less than necessary."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

## On relationships

> *"Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom."  
-- Kevin kelly*

> *"Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option."  
-- Mark Twain*

Focus on what you can give. However, after taking first steps, mirror their behavior. Don’t cross oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you.

Hints:

- If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.  
- If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.  
- Trust and vulnerability are correlated. Don’t hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.
- Sometimes connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.

> *"Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you."  
-- Dream Hampton*

> *"Play long-term games with long-term people. The secret to a happy relationship is two happy people. If you loose somebody for being yourself, then you never had them to begin with. Find a relationship where you, naturally being you, makes the other person happy and viceversa. The worst way to build a relationship is to try to build a relationship. The people you most want to impress can read your intentions."    
-- Naval Ravikant (paraphrased)*

## On networking

> *"To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery."  
-- Robert Greene*

> *"The enemy of excellence is isolation."  
-- Aaron Walker*

Make networking an habit. Who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

> *"Money is the ultimate network effect."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right."  
-- Charles Bukowski*

> *It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone."  
-- John Maynard Keynes*

### How to network?

<!--
> *"When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

- What’s the most common question or problem you get asked about? Share the answer.
- Community of experts (that give you good answers). Critical peers (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career).
- Not what should I do next but who should you speak next?
- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
- Networking types: shark, dolphin, drowner.  
-->

> *"Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Be useful, not important. Listen to people, get their goals and help them. It’s not about you, it’s about the impact you have on others and the legacy that you leave.

Hints:

- Social adeptness is balancing two seemingly opposing social strategies: competing and cooperating.
- Building new connections is important but it’s even more important to remember the connections that already exist.
- Form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give as much than they take. The best way to get value was to start giving it away even by giving validation.
- You’ll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.
- Social inadequacy (creepiness) is based on unpredictability. Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling or if you say hi.
- Field tactics:
	- «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
	- Eye contact builds trust. dont hide yourself. dont wait to start talking. a group or a double might be an easy place to start.
	- Small and open groups. Opening line: "Hi, I’m X and I dont know anybody in this party."  
	- Go to the bar and meet people there or help the hosters to serve food.
	- You should go on after 10 or 15 minutes, think about it as exploring. How to politely end conversations:
		- «Excuse me but I must to talk with somebody that entered the room.»
		- «Excuse me I have to make a phone call.»
		- Human sacrifice... Intro him and leave.
		- To rude people: «My mum always told me not to speak with strangers.»
- Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.

> *"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."  
-- Dale Carnegie*

> *"If you expect magic in every encounter, you’ll find it."  
-- Adam Robinson*

### Why most people don’t like networking?

Handling rejection is hard. Period.

We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves.

> *"Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

### How to prepare an elevator pitch?

<!--
I help (or a derivative) investors (target: people is too generalist but don’t over tailor it) to build better things (skill. use intrigue and confidence)
6 or 7 words -- short and sweet and confident and interesting. Costumise it for the context to make it more relevant.
-->

> *"When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments. Most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool. That story might be «rags to riches», «rising from the ashes», «one yes after a thousand nos», «crazy till I wasn’t» or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes."  
-- Jordan Harbinger*

Choose truth or your self-mythology will seduce you.

> *"I think the role of the entrepreneur in the world is to find ways to do things better or more efficiently and then try to do that as many times over with the help of other people."  
-- Santiago Nestares*

Focus on what you can easily give that empowers others.

It’s not about what you know, it’s about who trusts you to solve their problems. Often, it requires the technical skills. Always, it requires the persuasion skills.

Validate your business by finding paying clients. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. The more they pay, the more they value it - the consumer votes with his wallet.

### On entrepreneurship

First try to sell it. Than build it.

If you build something that people say they’ll pay for and then they don’t then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn’t make you a «wannapreneur». At that point it’s just part of the struggle.

Hints:

- If you have an idea, test it and launch now. It’s called putting out a “minimally viable product” or MVP. Timing is the most important factor in startup success (quick to start but not the first). Team and execution came next. Find the 80/20 solution. Don’t put a bunch of effort to find out there’s no paying demand. 
- The bottleneck for success often is not knowledge of the tools, but lack of understanding of the customer needs. It’s easier when YOU are the customer. Start with something you’re interested in. Don’t worry about the theory, focus on solving the problem.
- Do the math. When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?
- In some complex and mature markets if you start small you my never be able to compete with existent players.
- Create a culture that rewards killing ideas. Nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something, we saved a lot of money.
- Do things manually at first. Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want. Only after you are over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. 
- Focus on revenue generating activities: if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it or outsource them so you have more time to work on your cash flow.
- Deliver a little bit more than expected. That’ll help to get you some recommendations.
- Say «no» to nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients. Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.
- Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population. Budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.
- There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is false. Study your failures.  
- Most companies don’t die because they run out of money.  

<!--
- In Zero to One, Peter Thiel describes how PayPal achieved the critical mass of users needed for it to be useful:
For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users. Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling through. So we decided to pay people to sign up. We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time they referred a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate.
- There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There’s an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven’t hit the latter mark in a month, close.
-->

> *"What one piece of advice would you give someone starting a company?
Do something that most people think is hard. If you try something easy, there will be five other companies doing the same thing two months later. But if you try something that’s difficult at first, everything gets much easier as soon as you make it through those initial challenges. Competition will be lower, because everyone else thought it was too hard. Recruiting good people will be easier, because good people like doing hard things. And when you have better people and less competition, raising capital gets easier, too."  
-- David Velez (Nubank)*

> *"A startup isn’t really a company at all. A startup is a set of founders with hopefully a set of proprietary insights that are a result of them living in the future. Most of the great startups come from a great insight and a great insight usually occurs when someone is living in the future and they notice something that’s missing."*

- my prices are based on my talent, not your budget.
- sell the problem you solve, not the product you have.
- make clear agreements and hell yes agreements, keeping my agreements (90%), renegotiating agreements before they break, clean my agreements after breaking them.
- There is no such thing as "shortage" of anything. Just pay more, and you’ll get it.
- always negotiate. dont communicate weakness on your negotiation. your first reaction should be no reaction. fight impulse to imediatelly give the answer.
- Responding to Job Offers for Maximum Impact- Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.) Never make the first offer. Thank them. Set the tone for the negotiation. Display social proof/market validation. Set your “ask.” Help them visualize the win. Reiterate interest and close strong.
- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like: What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.

Letter One [Strong Response]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]
I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]
I look forward to your response. [Power close.]
Cheers,

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]
Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]
I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

- First establish a baseline — use Google. Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?” “Will you do that -10%?” “If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?” “If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?” “What if I pay cash?” “Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.” WALK AWAY.

- Unexpressed feelings never die. Releasing pressure is different from venting.

- One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show.
I said, “$1500”. She said, “Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?”
I said, “$2000”. She said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”
I said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”

We’re all in sales. To sell is to deal with objections.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it’s mostly applied persuasion and keeping relationships. Best sellers are now ambiverts. Being recomendend is the best marketing.

Traditional selling: hunters (extroverts)

- Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
- Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
- Persisting (to push until you make the sale)  

Modern selling: farmers (ambiverts and introverts)

- Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the web, reading and analyzing information)  
- Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
- Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

### On negotiation

<!--
- how to say no: When processing a “yes” or “no” to a request, don’t forget about your third option: negotiation.
- how to say no to an interview: i think i said already everthing about that subject.
- how to say no to something else: i think i did already what i can do.
- how much would i have to pay to close this deal now
- smart partners negotiate fair deals because they know that lopsided deals are fragile and that most value accumulates in long term trust relationships. you can tell a lot about a potential partner by their opening offer. (naval)
-->

> *"Negotiations are won by whoever cares less."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

You don’t get what you deserve in life, only what you negotiate.

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value). That said, a good negotiation means that you are paying less money (or value) than receiving value (or money).

Hints:

- To negotiate you need to have options.
- To go fast, let the other part go first.
- You can only negotiate with integrous people.
- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating. The analytical cold guy is very patient. The assertive guy wants to make it fast. For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important.
- Be playful and smart. Your counter-part will often mirror your good mood.
- Mirroring by repeating the last few words of the other person. It opens up people’s brain. It tests the firmness of what they want.
- Never negotiate with binary questions: prefer «What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.
- Show arbitrage: If they pay X, now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the only way to sell.
- Close it: «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. When people feel they have a choice, they «walk into your trap» that much more easily.
- People buy better versions of themselves, not products.
- Females buy male products. Males don’t buy products targetted to females.
- Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.
- Marketing is a symptom of excess production.

## On feedback and mentorship

<!--
> *"Tact is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."  
-- Winston Churchill*

- don’t take criticism from people that you would never go for advice.
- what do i do that is most annoying to u? say thank you and don’t discuss it. don’t act on it. just put it in your mind.
-->

> *"To know the road ahead, ask those coming back."  
-- Unknown*

Feedback from mentors speeds up improvement. Even if you can’t understand the logic behind their wisdom, they’ll show you the door.

Be generous and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

> *"You don’t need mentors, you need action." (...) 
"Take feedback from nature and markets, not from people." (...)

> *"Don’t follow your mentors; follow your mentors’ mentors."

### How to mentor your kids?

> *"If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you."  
-- Markus Zusak*

Your father is your first mentor.

Don’t tell your kids how to live. Live fully and let them see. Spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

<!--
- If you don’t have kids you’ll be the first organism of your direct ancestors to not reproduce since the beggining of life. 
- we are raising weak men and girls who need validation because their father wasn’t there.
- teenagers = treated like children but expected to act like adults
- the letter i wrote my kids after they born: you might think you want an expensive car, fancy watch and a huge car. but i’m telling you, you don’t. what you want is respect and admiration from other people and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. it almost nver does especially from the people you want it.
- ask coolest moment of their week or favorite food.
- monthly photo of your kid room and yearly lenghty video of your kid speaking
> *"Children are natural mimics who act like their parents despite every effort to teach them good manners. Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually *repeat word for word what you shouldn’t have said.*
-->

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).  
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar. Parents prevent their kid from dying but as they get older they shouldn’t prevent them from living.

## On generosity and incentives

> *"No one has ever become poor by giving."  
-- Anne Frank*

> *"A bit of fragrance clings to the hand that gives flowers."  
-- Unknown*

No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.

Hints:

- If you can afford the dinner you can afford the tip.
- Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.
- A low value gift may have the opposite effect.

> *"He that gives should never remember and he that receives should never forget."  
-- Talmud*

> *"The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he’d learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I’ll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn’t be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people’s talents. He’d hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn’t want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there." (...)  
"My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn’t lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human."  
-- HN_danielvf*

> *"Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity."  
-- Weil*

### On incentives

Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.

Hints:

- We learn complex behaviors via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. After the behaviour is learnt, continuous reinforcement becomes intermitent reinforcement.
- Instead of punishments extingue rewards.
- The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your presence and attention.

## On hierarchy

<!--
> *"No hay prepotencia más ridícula que la que se destila de la creencia de que recopilar talento ajeno es un talento."  
-- Jorge Luis Borges*

- Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren’t random or stupid.
- People like to feel in control. if we try them to get them do something, people feel disempowered. if they feel that somebody is deciding for them they say no when they would be happy to go along.
-->

> *"If you want to know who controls you, look at who you are not allowed to criticize."  
-- Voltaire*

> *"No one can make you feel inferior without your permission."  
-- Eleanor Roosevelt*

Everything is hierarchy. Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

However don’t vow to the gatekeepers. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It’s a business relationship.

> *"Nothing strengthens authority so much as silence."  
-- Leonardo da Vinci*

## On society and politics

<!--
> *"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the people discover they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury. From that moment on, the majority always votes for the candidate promising the most benefits from the public treasury, with the result that democracy always collapses over a loose fiscal policy–to be followed by a dictatorship."

> *"Não há direitos sem obrigações e viceversa."  
-- E. Ferreira*

> *"It doesn’t matter what you do, it only matters what you say you’ve done and what you’re going to do.*

- As humans, we are tribal by nature. Our natural default is to see ourselves as part of some group that’s struggling against some other group(s) at all times. And once we’re part of our little group, our little tribe, we adopt all sorts of biases and preferences. We construct belief systems that justify our group’s power and superiority. We create tests of whether other people are “true” and “pure” members of our group, and we either shame any “non-believers” into conformity or simply expel them from the tribe.
Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.
But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.
The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.
And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.

> *"For the friends: everything. For the others: the law."  
-- Niccoló Machiavelli (paraphrased)*

Politicians hate risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending people, specially their voters.

## On following the herd

> *"Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean."  
-- Charlie Munger*

Society is run by peer pressure, not intelligence.

Most people are other people. People accept the defaults very easily. Our thoughts are someone else opinions and we jump to conclusions. Our insecurities drive us to excess and overcompensation. We are, at heart, animals and we are easily manipulated, especially in groups.

Groups of people behave differently than individuals. The larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. This effect is known as mob behaviour. This is also why individuals should make decisions. Groups never admit failure.

### On stupidity

> *"Stupidity is overlooking or dismissing crucial information."  
-- Adam Robinson*

Stupidity is the cost of intelligence operating in a complex environment and it’s almost inevitable. Most people don’t actually think, they just take their first thought and go. There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default. That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!», it means they’ve stopped thinking.

### How to judge a man?

> *"Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers."  
-- Voltaire*

We judge ourselves by our thoughts but society judges us by what we can do for them.

Hints:

- When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability.
- Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.

> *"Fools and wise folk are alike harmless. It is the half-wise and the half-foolish, who are the most dangerous."

Beware of all players.

People are amazing optimizers and will find any loopholes or gaps to their advantage. Only your parents will help you in a way that is prejudicial to them.

> *"Show me a hero, and I’ll write you a tragedy."  
-- F. Scott Fitzgerald*

> *"The enemy is fear. We think it is hate, but it is fear."

### On desperate opponents

> *"Necessity knows no law."  
-- Unknown*

> *"Fear can make a donkey attack a lion."  
-- Unknown*

Beware of sad people.

Desperate players will risk everything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *"Don’t fight a starving animal. Never contend with a man who has nothing to Lose; for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict. The other enters without anxiety; having lost everything, including shame, he has no further loss to fear. He therefore re-sorts to all kinds of insolence."  
-- Balthasar Gracian*

> *"Beware the fury of a patient man."  
-- John Dryden*

### On difficult opponents

<!--
- the thougest competition is a good enough competitor.
-->

Besides outworking them, you’ll need all weaponry. Sometimes even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff». They may be effective but use them only on desperate situations: it’s a scar for life.

> *"Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit." (...)

-- Lao Tzu*

When nothing else works, surrender. Only use anger and go all in if you can see the end already.

> *"Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?"

### On allies

<!--

The human strenght is the ability to cooperate. Heros are fictional stories.

Hint:

- Buy from your community. Sell to outsiders.

## On conflicts

> *"War is what happens when language fails."  
-- Margaret Atwood*

Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it. Rotten peace builds resentment.

Small (but relevant) conflicts will grow into big conflicts. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship.

### On conflict resolution

You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Hints:

- Use «we». Mean it and take responsability.  
- Bring options to the table. It’s easier to negotiate down.  

> *"To quiet a crowd or a drunk, just whisper. Calm is contagious." (...)  
"Your best response to an insult is «you’re probably right». Often they are."

# 2.3 - On teams

## On leadership

<!--
- a autoridade é delegavel mas a responsabilidade n é delegavel

> *"An army of sheep led by a lion is better than an army of lions led by a sheep."  
-- Alexander the great*

> *"To lead people walk behind them." (...)  
"A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves."  
-- Lao Tzu*

Leaders are team makers. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

Being a leader is different from being a boss: it requires to be a manager and a psychotherapist. Leadership is based on emotional intelligence, people don’t follow robots, they follow the strongest person. The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Leadership is the ability to locate yourself. 

Hints:

- Leaders are embassadors of their teams. They can delegate culture keeping but not culture creation. 
- If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.
- Best leaders are leaders that grew up in the hierarchy.  
- People seek leadership because they want autonomy and influence. Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.

> *"Leadership is not about being followed, is about being first."  
-- Dan Munro*

> *"You can tell a bully from a leader by how they treat people who disagree with them."

## On management and delegation

<!--
- reward system. culture is influenced by structure. give to the right person
- as estruturas funcionam qd ha coesao
- Ideas are welcomed, execution is worshiped
-->

> *"Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today."  
-- Warren Buffett*

Managing is delegating. A great manager is a great facilitator. His responsability is to make his team better. 

Hints:

- A manager should answer two questions a day: «What is important to accomplish?» and «Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.  
- Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive. The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of being busy pretending you’re occupied, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be. 
- Spend one hour a day communicating to your people and everything will be OK.
- Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it’s more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive». The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

### On teams

> *"If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."  
-- Unknown*

People should feel as part of a tribe. While the tribe is cohese, external threats will pass.

Hints:

- Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You cannot expect from them what you haven’t articulated, usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.
- A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
- Like animals, humans also seem designed to work in groups of a particular size. The ultimate group: Amazon’s «two-pizza teams». 

> *"I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, stupid, diligent and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief."  
-- Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord*

> *"There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it."  
-- Edith Wharton*

### How to give feedback?

> *"The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent»."  
-- HN_exelius*

Ask instead of telling.

Continue, or consider. You give feedback that says either «continue doing X» or «consider changing X to make it better». If the delivered work is not good enough give a reason. It’s really simple, fast and actionable.

Hints:

- «Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.
- «Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.
- «Interesting, how do you feel about it? And your team? Is that the best you can do?»

> *"Praise by name, criticize by category."  
-- Warren Buffet*

> *"To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth"  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators. Howewer, don’t do it daily.

### On meetings

<!--
- text me when you’re ready but then give me 15 minutes.
-->

Default to «no» for all meetings. Meetings are the death of productivity.

If you can’t say no, schedule for the afternoon and preferably as walking meetings (exercise and sunlight; less pleasantries; more dialogue, less monologue; no slides; end easily by walking back).

Hints:

- Start with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 20%?».  
- Do not share your opinion before asking for input from your team. Lower ranked people should speak first.  
- Tell the bad news promptly. Good news can wait. (Berkshire policy)
- People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.
- Instead of PowerPoints use «narratives» — four-to-six page memos that employees read and discuss together. (Jeff Bezos)
- Leave one seat free - for your customer. (Jeff Bezos)

### How to advance career?

> *"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you’re unstoppable."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Become the best at one specific thing or very good at two or more things.

Hints:

- You don’t get anywhere, and for more money, sitting in the same seat.
- Happy, smart, and useful. Work smart not harder but hard still. It’s good to be better, but is better to be different.
- Metaknowledge (instead of asking, journal higher hierarchy than you).
- Deliver more value than expected.

> *"While deep work will promote you, shallow work will only prevent you from being fired."

> *"Oh, this is an easy one. When people say a child is talented they mean he or she is a good learner. But a talented adult is a good do-er. High potential people who fail to make an impact are stuck in child-mode, because that is what they were always praised for."  
-- HN_goatinaboat*

> *"I had a manager who once said the people who were terminated were those who question too much and do too little."
-- Unknown*

### How to «pivot» career?

> *"The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by."  
-- Robert Greene*

You will either pivot or get pivoted.

Avoid the trap of following one set career path, focus on being useful. My passionate interests have changed many times since I graduated college. You are a learning machine, not an occupation. Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.

> *"Jobs are like clothes. There is no "wrong job". There are jobs which fit now."
-- Unknown*

> *"My luggage is always ready."  
-- Jorge Jesus*

You make yourself rare by combining two or more relevant «pretty goods». Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable.

- use your transportable soft (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody’s opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills (write a pitch, can you change somebody else opinion, make a 2 minute youtube, etc) 
- stuff that looks fun for you and looks like work for others.
- take risks to boost your immune system.  

> *"Your income is directly proportional to the need for what you do and your ability to do it."  
-- Jim Rohn*

> *"Be so good that they cannot ignore you." (...)  
"Career capital is the unique skills that make you rare and valuable."  
-- Cal Newport*

### Employee or entrepreneur?

Employees have no control over their futures. The economy forces all the risk on them.

Hints:

- When you sell your ability to deliver results nobody asks about your skillset. When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need.  
- Rich people get paid by project and pay by the hour.  
- The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn’t want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn’t get for it, is a failure in his eyes.

> *"A taste of freedom can make you unemployable." (...)  
"An entrepreneur without drive is just an unemployed." (...)  
"Earn with your mind, not with your time." (...)  
"You’re never going to get rich renting out your time." (...)  
"Trade money for time, not time for money. You’re going to run out of time first."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### Specialist or generalist?

<!--
- There’s nothing wrong in specialization -- it’s how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don’t have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.
-->

Hints:

- To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.  
- To be employed, if you pick the right specialization, you’ll do better as a specialist.
- Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists.

### How to know your strenghts?
 
Ask employers why did they asked you for an interview - they will describe your strengths.

> *"Our best work is the work we find ourselves doing, when there is no obligation to do so."

## On hiring and being hired

<!--
- People want freedom to choose their process.
- Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas. In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction". Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.
- Money is trust. system of mutual trust.
- Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.
- T ou pi shaped.

> *"He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist."  
-- St. Francis of Assisi*

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».

Your goal should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are. Leaders must become masters at finding and hiring talent.

Hints:

- When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant. Don’t do interviews, do discussions.
- Employers are just trying to find somebody they like, that’s what «culture fit» is. Often is not how good you are, you just have to be liked while being sufficiently good. Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you. And people like people like themselves.
- Good interview questions:
	- «What are there problems you’ve solved and how did you solve them?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What did you get done this week?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What do you own and why?» (Sandy Gottesman, investor)
- Remember that I’d hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I’d not have had to hire them. Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
- Companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist. Growing companies are always hiring.
- Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.
- A job search is both a numbers game and a quality game. You can control how many jobs you apply to, and how good your skills and portfolio are.

> *"Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers."  
-- Jacques Mattheij*

> *"We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values."

"Management is mostly hiring well and firing quickly."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

### On resumes

> *"Your real resume is a painful recounting of all your struggles."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

Hints:

- Your resume should tell the reader why you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience. Tell HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person. ie. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.
- There are two skill levels: still learning or confident.

### How to attract and keep talented people?

Respect them. You’ll never respect them if you don’t reward them accordingly.

Hints:

- Use «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process. Usually people leave managers, not companies.
- Smart people will not work extremely hard just for money.
- Good employees are not easy to find. It takes some real *chutzpah* to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.
- Asking for a raise. Don’t get discouraged if you get a «no». Simply thank them for their time and ask «What specific outcomes would be required to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?» If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

> *"Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to."
