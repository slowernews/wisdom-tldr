# 2.1 - On cooperation

## On communication

> *"Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens."  
-- Jimi Hendrix [1942]*

Speak less and listen more. Talk slow. Be clear. Never mumble. Don’t interrupt. If you can’t be kind, be quiet. The quieter you become. The more you can hear.

> *"A silent man is the best one to listen to." (...)  
"Say a little and say it well." (...)  
"Silence cannot be misquoted."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Give me the gift of a listening heart."  
-- King Solomon [-970]*

> *"A fool is known by his speech, and a wise man by silence."  
-- Pythagoras [-570]*

> *"Know how to listen and you will profit even from those who talk badly."  
-- Plutarch [0046]*

> *"The best way to become boring is to say everything."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"Don’t talk unless you can improve the silence."  
-- Jorge Luis Borges [1899]*

> *"People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk [1963]*

> *"The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said."  
-- Peter Drucker [1909]*

### How to communicate? 

> *"If you want to be interesting, be interested."  
-- David Ogilvy [1911]*

Be interested to be interesting. Don’t debate at all. Just listen. The point of a conversation is not to win. You don’t need to have an opinion about everything. Get fewer opinions about way fewer things and then interrogate your stronger opinions.

Hints:

- Listen. Mirroring or paraphrase: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question or repeat what they just said in your own words. (Yes, it’s that simple). Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Don’t worry about what you’re going to say next. Speak what’s in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Be interested to be interesting. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..
- Ask questions. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. No one is boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions. But you must be curious, asking questions without paying attention is worthless. Making good/unusual questions will make people interested in you. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It’s hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but cF\rucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments or asking for advice.
- Stop trying to impress. Focus on being interested instead of being interesting. Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and it will appear as fake. Smile and relax. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people always smile more. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Don’t be stubborn. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don’t judge. Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.
- Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day.
- People believe in everything, if you whisper it.

> *"The more you say, the less people remember."  
-- François Fénelon [1651]*

> *"Think like a wise man but communicate in the language of the people."  
-- W.B. Yeats [1865]*

> *"A little inaccuracy sometimes saves tons of explanation."  
-- H.H. Munro [1870]*

> *"Two monologues do not make a dialogue."  
-- Mikhail Bakhtin [1895]*

> *"Everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are married or own a house; as if life was some kind of grocery list. But nobody ever asks if you are happy."  
-- Heath Ledger [1979]*

### How to discord?

<!--
> *"A bore is someone who persists in holding his own views after we have enlightened him with ours."*

- A loucura é a incapacidade de comunicar-se.
-->

> *"Admit when you’re wrong. Shut up when you’re right."  
-- John Gottman [1942]*

Don’t raise your voice. improve your argument.

Listen as you’re wrong. Ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. If they can explain why they are correct, you’ll learn something. If they can’t you’ll soften their views. The more we disagree, the more chance there is that at least one of us is right.

> *"Be curious, not judgmental."  
-- Walt Witman [1819]*

> *"Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference." (...)  
"Never argue with stupid people, because they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Tact is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"With truly logical people, most arguments are very short and based mainly on differing assumptions."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to tell stories?

> *"Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out."  
-- Alfred Hitchcock [1899]*

Good stories condense a massive amount of details into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment.

> *"To tell a good story, you must reveal a surprise; otherwise is just a report."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On public speaking

<!--
- study your audience reaction more than yourself.
-->

> *"Eloquence is logic on fire."  
-- Lyman Beecher [1775]*

Hints:

- You don’t need to answer their questions. You can say whatever you want if it’s interesting but learn when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions.
- Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of desagreeing.

> *"If you want to reach a large audience, appeal to idiots."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer [1788]*

> *"A good speech should be like a woman’s skirt: long enough to cover the subject and short enought o create interest."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"Improvisation is the ability to talk with oneself."  
-- Cecil Taylor [1929]*

> *"Always say less than necessary."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone." (...)  
"The art of conversation is best practiced between three to four people."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On networking

> *"The enemy of excellence is isolation."  
-- Aaron Walker [1910]*

Make networking an habit. Who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

> *It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone."  
-- John Maynard Keynes [1883]*

> *"Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right."  
-- Charles Bukowski [1920]*

> *"To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"Money is the ultimate network effect." (...)  
"Nothing will attract people to you as much as your values."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to network?

> *"Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead." (...)  
"When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Be useful, not important. Listen to people, get their goals and help them. It’s not about you, it’s about the impact you have on others.

<!--
- Community of experts (that give you good answers). Critical peers (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career).
- everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying, «Make me feel important». Never forget this message when working with people.
- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
- Networking types: shark, dolphin, drowner.
- Not what should I do next but who should you speak next?
- What’s the most common question or problem you get asked about? Share the answer.
- Avoid forcing connections.
- Do not beg. Do not call twice. Do not explain yourself. Do not simp. Respect yourself. Do not insult yourself: If they reject you, they are not worthy of your presence.
- shyness costs a fortune
- The first time you meet people, treat them as well as you possibly can – after that, treat them as they treat you.
- When you first meet someone, introduce yourself as a nobody, watch how they treat you, you will gauge their true character, you will understand how they treat others.
- You don’t meet people by accident. There’s always a reason. A lesson or a blessing.
-->

Hints:

- Social adeptness is balancing two seemingly opposing social strategies: competing and cooperating.
- Building new connections is important but it’s even more important to remember the connections that already exist.
- Form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give as much than they take. The best way to get value was to start giving it away even by giving validation.
- You’ll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.
- Social inadequacy (creepiness) is based on unpredictability. Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling or if you say hi.
- Field tactics:
	- «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
	- Eye contact builds trust. Don’t hide yourself. Don’t wait to start talking. A group or a double might be an easy place to start.
	- Small and open groups. Opening line: "Hi, I’m X and I dont know anybody in this party."  
	- Go to the bar and meet people there or help the hosters to serve food.
	- You should go on after 10 or 15 minutes, think about it as exploring. How to politely end conversations:
		- «Excuse me but I must to talk with somebody that entered the room.»
		- «Excuse me I have to make a phone call.»
		- Human sacrifice... Introduce him and leave.
		- To rude people: «My mum always told me not to speak with strangers.»
- Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.

> *"I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."  
-- Dale Carnegie [1888]*

> *"If you expect magic in every encounter, you’ll find it."  
-- Adam Robinson [1955]*

> *"Millenials who learn the dark Boomer arts of phone calls and eye contact will inherit the earth."  
-- x@molson_hart*

### Why most people don’t like networking?

Handling rejection is hard. Period. We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves.

> *"Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works."

> *"If you can’t sell yourself in 1 sentence you won’t be able to sell yourself in several paragraphs."  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

Choose truth or your self-mythology will seduce you.

> *"When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments. Most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool. That story might be «rags to riches», «rising from the ashes», «one yes after a thousand nos», «crazy till I wasn’t» or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes."  
-- x@jordanharbinger*

> *"when you want to tell stories, be it startup pitches, or just stories about your experiences, always share them in three points—no more, no less. the human mind & the underlying world gravitates towards threes, look at any industry, typically the equilibrium points lie in threes. there are also numerous other examples that paint this phenomena. it’s a magic number for communication. story tellers rule the world."

They’re eating food that might be marginally better than yours, but it’s basically the same. You might even have a better diet than them. You probably have more time to go to the gym than them. They’re not immortal, and they’re not going to be—most likely, not at this time scale. So you have more youth than them. You have a lot of advantages over them. The wealth gaps are actually much smaller than people think. A lot of that is due to mass production, which comes from specialization, labor, and capitalism. But it’s very easy to overlook that and agitate—because that gets you higher in the status hierarchy with other monkeys. It makes you look like you’re fighting for noble causes and gives you status, which is really what people are craving these days. They’re craving status, not money or wealth. And status is a zero-sum game. So it’s kind of an evil game to play because there have to be losers for every winner. And the only way to win is by crushing somebody else down."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"I think the role of the entrepreneur in the world is to find ways to do things better or more efficiently and then try to do that as many times over with the help of other people."  
-- Santiago Nestares [1997]*

Focus on what you can easily give that empowers others.

Validate your business by finding paying clients. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. The more they pay, the more they value it - the consumer votes with his wallet. It’s not about what you know, it’s about who trusts you to solve their problems. Often, it requires the technical skills. Always, it requires the persuasion skills.

First try to sell it. Than build it.

If you build something that people say they’ll pay for and then they don’t then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn’t make you a «wannapreneur». At that point it’s just part of the struggle.

Hints:

- If you have an idea, test it and launch now. It’s called putting out a “minimally viable product” or MVP. Timing is the most important factor in startup success (quick to start but not the first). Team and execution came next. Find the 80/20 solution. Don’t put a bunch of effort to find out there’s no paying demand. 
- The bottleneck for success often is not knowledge of the tools, but lack of understanding of the customer needs. It’s easier when YOU are the customer. Start with something you’re interested in. Don’t worry about the theory, focus on solving the problem.
- Do the math. When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?
- In some complex and mature markets if you start small you my never be able to compete with existent players.
- Create a culture that rewards killing ideas. Nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something, we saved a lot of money.
- Do things manually at first. Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want. Only after you are over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. 
- Focus on revenue generating activities: if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it or outsource them so you have more time to work on your cash flow.
- Deliver a little bit more than expected. That’ll help to get you some recommendations.
- «Fire» nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients.
- Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population. Budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.
- There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is true only if you study your failures.

Competition will be lower, because everyone else thought it was too hard. Recruiting good people will be easier, because good people like doing hard things. And when you have better people and less competition, raising capital gets easier, too."

- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like: What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.
- always negotiate. dont communicate weakness on your negotiation. your first reaction should be no reaction. fight impulse to imediatelly give the answer.
- If you run enough A/B tests online, you’ll end up with a porn site.
- make clear agreements and hell yes agreements, keeping my agreements (90%), renegotiating agreements before they break, clean my agreements after breaking them.
- marketing position makes sense when there is confusion who your client is. know where you fit and what can you offer better the next guy. help your client to make a decision. let them understand if your product is teh right for them.
- my prices are based on my talent, not your budget.
- Raise your prices, lower your stress.
- Responding to Job Offers for Maximum Impact- Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.) Never make the first offer. Thank them. Set the tone for the negotiation. Display social proof/market validation. Set your “ask.” Help them visualize the win. Reiterate interest and close strong.
- sell the problem you solve, not the product you have.
- There is no such thing as "shortage" of anything. Just pay more, and you’ll get it.

Letter One [Strong Response]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]
I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]
I look forward to your response. [Power close.]
Cheers,
Alex “Dream Employee” Kouts

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]
Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]
I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

- First establish a baseline — use Google. Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?” “Will you do that -10%?” “If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?” “If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?” “What if I pay cash?” “Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.” WALK AWAY.
- Unexpressed feelings never die. Releasing pressure is different from venting.
- The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.
- Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.
- Cold call all owners to rent. 8 said yes. Then auction! 
- irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don’t want to do. agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. agitate more than irritate.
- how to say no: When processing a “yes” or “no” to a request, don’t forget about your third option: negotiation.
- how to say no to an interview: i think i said already everthing about that subject.
- how to say no to something else: i think i did already what i can do.
- how much would i have to pay to close this deal now
- smart partners negotiate fair deals because they know that lopsided deals are fragile and that most value accumulates in long term trust relationships. you can tell a lot about a potential partner by their opening offer. (naval)

> *"Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don’t need."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk [1963]*

We’re all in sales. To sell is to deal with objections.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it’s mostly applied persuasion and keeping relationships. Best sellers are now ambiverts. Being recomendend is the best marketing.

Traditional selling: hunters (extroverts)

- Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
- Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
- Persisting (to push until you make the sale)  

Modern selling: farmers (ambiverts and introverts)

- Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the web, reading and analyzing information)  
- Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
- Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

-- Henry Ford [1863]*

Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp."  
-- Ryan Holiday [1987]*

### On negotiation
	
<!--
> *"He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation."*

- You are not paid what you are worth. You are paid what you negotiate for.
-->

> *"Negotiations are won by whoever cares less."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

You don’t get what you deserve in life, only what you negotiate.

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value). That said, a good negotiation means that you are giving less money (or value) than receiving value (or money).

Hints:

- You can only negotiate with integrous people.
- To negotiate you need to have options.
- To go fast, let the other part go first.
- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating. The analytical cold guy is very patient. The assertive guy wants to make it fast. For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important.
- Be playful and smart. Your counter-part will often mirror your good mood.
- Mirroring by repeating the last few words of the other person. It opens up people’s brain. It tests the firmness of what they want.
- Show arbitrage: If they pay X, now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the only way to sell.
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.
- Never negotiate with binary questions: prefer «What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»
- Close it: «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. When people feel they have a choice, they «walk into your trap» that much more easily.
- People buy better versions of themselves, not products.
- Females buy male products. Males don’t buy products targetted to females.
- Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.
- Marketing is a symptom of excess production.

> *"Flattery is the infantry of negotiation."  
-- (Lord Chandos) Hugo von Hofmannsthal [1872]*

> *"People may or may not say what they mean but they always say something designed to get what they want."  
-- David Mamet [1947]*

> *"When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

However always strive to achieve a win-win situation. When both sides don’t take what they need from it, the deal may fall. The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.

> *"Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"You can’t make a good deal with a bad person."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"When negotiating, dont aim for a bigger piece of the pie; aim to create a bigger pie."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show. I said, «$1500». She said, «Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?» I said, «$2000». She said, «No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!» I said, «Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.» She liked that so much she came up with the $1500."  
-- Derek Sivers [1969]*

> *"Zero-sum games tend towards conflict. Positive-sum games tend towards cooperation."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### On price

<!--
- When money’s free, nobody looks at the price.
-->

> *"Price is what you pay, value is what you get."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Price is a filter. Set it to choose the customers you prefer to work with. If they can’t pay, walk away.

> *"The price of anything is the amount of life you exchange for it."  
-- Henry David Thoreau [1817]*

> *"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource."  
-- Allen Tucker [1866]*

> *"When you don’t know how much to pay someone for a particular task, ask them «what would be fair» and their answer usually is."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Pay double and insist on ten times the quality." (...)  
"If it takes an expert to tell you what it’s worth, it isn’t worth anything."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"At some point you begin to define «expensive» in terms of time instead of money."  
-- x@realestatetrent*






## On generosity and incentives

> *"No one has ever become poor by giving."  
-- Anne Frank [1929]*

No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.

Hints:

- If you can afford the dinner you can afford the tip.
- Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.
- A low value gift may have the opposite effect.

> *"A bit of fragrance clings to the hand that gives flowers." (...)  
"A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle." (...)  
"A guest and a fish stink in three days."  
-- vox populi*

> *"He that gives should never remember and he that receives should never forget."  
-- Talmud*

> *"Givers have to set limits because takers rarely do."  
-- Henry Ford [1863]*

> *"If you are more fortunate than others, build a longer table rather than a taller fence."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Use money to reward the best, not to motivate the rest."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity."  
-- Simone Weil [1909]*

> *"The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have."  
-- Leonard Nimoy [1931]*

> *"The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he’d learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I’ll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn’t be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people’s talents. He’d hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn’t want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there." (...)  
"My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn’t lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human."  
-- hn@danielvf*

### On incentives

> *"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, there are consequences."  
-- Robert G. Ingersoll [1833]*

Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.

Hints:

- We learn complex behaviors via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. After the behaviour is learnt, continuous reinforcement becomes intermitent reinforcement.
- Instead of punishments extingue rewards.
- The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your presence and attention.
- Punish bad behavior consistently, reward good behavior intermittently

> *"Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education."  
-- Zhuang Zhou [-369]*

> *"Never take compliments personally. People compliment you because they like you, not because you’re perfect."  
-- x@farshadsarrafi*






## On leadership

<!--
- a autoridade é delegavel mas a responsabilidade n é delegavel
- a leader makes the people next to them better version of themselves.
- A man asked a gardener why his plants grew so beautifully. The gardener said: «I don’t force them to grow. I remove what stops them.»
- convincing vs inspiring leadership
- Lou Holtz has a very pithy mental model for how to evaluate leadership: 1. Can I trust you? 2. Do you care about me? 3. Are you committed to excellence?
- never make a numbers person the leader
- Proactive problem management – Go directly to the source.
- succeful takers are the most visible people in organizations.
- the organization is always modelling the leader. military leader don’t have money to distribute. is way easier. monetary bonus are more a requirement than a motivator now and is negative because people may think they getting unfairly treated.
- There are three keys: honesty, effectiveness, and efficiency.
-->

> *"To lead people walk behind them." (...)  
"A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

Leaders are team makers. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

Being a leader is different from being a boss: it requires to be a manager and a psychotherapist. Leadership is based on emotional intelligence, people don’t follow robots, they follow the strongest person. The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Leadership is the ability to locate yourself. 

Hints:

- Leaders are embassadors of their teams. They can delegate culture keeping but not culture creation. 
- If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.
- Best leaders are leaders that grew up in the hierarchy.
- People seek leadership because they want autonomy and influence. Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.

## On management and delegation

<!--
+ x@kunalb11 -- Introverts who hate managing people may be first to automate most things with AI.

- as estruturas funcionam qd ha coesao
- good managers shield their team from all the noise coming from above and give them a calm environment to work in. Bad managers amplify the noise and make the team feel every silly whim of upper management.
- Ideas are welcomed, execution is worshiped
- reward system. culture is influenced by structure. give to the right person
-->

> *"Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Managing is delegating. A great manager is a great facilitator. His responsability is to make his team better. 

Hints:

- A manager should answer two questions a day: «What is important to accomplish?» and «Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.
- Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive. The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of being busy pretending you’re occupied, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be. 
- Spend one hour a day communicating to your people and everything will be OK.
- Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it’s more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive». The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

-- Phill Dooley [1966]*

People should feel as part of a tribe. While the tribe is cohese, external threats will pass.

Hints:

- Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You cannot expect from them what you haven’t articulated, usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.
- A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
- Like animals, humans also seem designed to work in groups of a particular size. The ultimate group: Amazon’s «two-pizza teams».

### How to give feedback?

<!--
TEN TIPS ON GIVING FEEDBACK
- Give at least five times more positive feedback than negative.
- Give feedback soon after the behavior you want to respond to.
- Pick the moment when both of you are in the right frame of mind.
- Keep it private. Feedback is not a spectator sport.
- Prepare. Take the time to organize what you want to say.
- Avoid generalities. Cite specific examples.
- Focus on the issue or behavior, not the person.
- Pay attention to body language. Adjust your feedback accordingly.
- Keep it simple. Don’t focus on too many things at once.

Ask instead of telling.

Continue, or consider. You give feedback that says either «continue doing X» or «consider changing X to make it better». If the delivered work is not good enough give a reason. It’s really simple, fast and actionable.

Hints:

- «Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.
- «Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.
- «Interesting, how do you feel about it? And your team? Is that the best you can do?»

Giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators. Howewer, don’t do it daily.

### On meetings

> *"The most senior person at a meeting should speak last."  
-- Jeff Bezos [1964]*

Default to «no» for all meetings. Meetings are the death of productivity.

If you can’t say no, schedule for the afternoon and preferably as walking meetings (exercise and sunlight; less pleasantries; more dialogue, less monologue; no slides; end easily by walking back).

Hints:

- Start with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 20%?».
- Do not share your opinion before asking for input from your team. Lower ranked people should speak first.
- Tell the bad news promptly. Good news can wait. (Berkshire policy)
- People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.
- Instead of PowerPoints use «narratives» — four-to-six page memos that employees read and discuss together. (Jeff Bezos)
- Leave one seat free - for your customer. (Jeff Bezos)
- Text me when you’re ready for the call but then give me 15 minutes.

## On mentorship

<!--
+ x@dears_o_n -- You’re a man. Never argue with your father. Shut up or walk away.

- Teach principles, not formulas. Understand, don’t memorize.
- What do I do that is most annoying to you? Say thank you and don’t discuss it. Don’t act on it. JRtruust put it in your mind.
-->

> *"To know the road ahead, ask those coming back."  
-- vox populi*

Feedback from mentors speeds up improvement. Even if you can’t understand the logic behind their wisdom, they’ll show you the door. Don’t take criticism from people that you would never go for advice.

Be generous and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

### How to find mentors?

> *"When the student is ready the teacher appears. When the student is truly ready the teacher disapeers."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

A paid mentor isn’t a mentor. It’s a salesperson.

Look for the «silver medalist». He has more availability, and sometimes, a better attitude than «the golden child».

### How to mentor your kids?

<!--
+ @naval -- "Children are happy because: 1) They're not self conscious 2) They lack a sense of time pressure 3) They've no goals. The bottom line is they are living from moment to moment, and the mind is not there to interfere in their bliss."

- Absent parent: troubled child
- A father is the one who reveals the truth about life to the kids. A mother is the one who comforts them after hearing it.
- children don’t need a perfect teacher. they need a happy teacher, who’s gonna make them excited to come to school and grow a love for learning.
- Children learn to be kind by experiencing kindness. Not by being told to be kind.
- your child’s behaviour triggers you because deep down inside lives a child that was shamed for behaving the same way.
-->

> *"Teach your children early what you learned late." (...)  
"Teach your children how to think, not what to think."  
-- Richard Feynman [1918]*

Your father is your first mentor.

Don’t tell your kids how to live. Live fully and let them see. Spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

Prepare the child for the path, not the child for the path.

<!--
> *"My partner teacher does this lovely thing when a student in his class gives him an «I don’t know» response. He simply says, «tell me something you do know that might be helpful»."
> *"Presence rids us of the need for parenting «strategies», many of which are more manipulative than nurturing."  -- Julie Louisson *

- we become good parents when you start to control yourself instead of controlling your child.
- If you don’t have kids you’ll be the first organism of your direct ancestors to not reproduce since the beggining of life. 
- we are raising weak men and girls who need validation because their father wasn’t there.
- teenagers = treated like children but expected to act like adults
- the letter i wrote my kids after they born: you might think you want an expensive car, fancy watch and a huge car. but i’m telling you, you don’t. what you want is respect and admiration from other people and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. it almost nver does especially from the people you want it.
- ask coolest moment of their week or favorite food.
- monthly photo of your kid room and yearly lenghty video of your kid speaking
> *"Children are natural mimics who act like their parents despite every effort to teach them good manners. Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually *repeat word for word what you shouldn’t have said.*
-->

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar. Parents prevent their kid from dying but as they get older they shouldn’t prevent them from living.

> *"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you’re unstoppable."

Become the best at one specific thing or very good at two or more things.

Hints:

- You don’t get anywhere, and for more money, sitting in the same seat.
- Happy, smart, and useful. Work smart not harder but hard still. It’s good to be better, but is better to be different.
- Metaknowledge (instead of asking, journal higher hierarchy than you).
- Deliver more value than expected.

> *"My theory: career pivots keep you young/hungry/foolish."  
-- x@ashleymayer*

You make yourself rare by combining two or more relevant «pretty goods». Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable.

- use your transportable soft (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody’s opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills (write a pitch, can you change somebody else opinion, make a 2 minute youtube, etc) 
- stuff that looks fun for you and looks like work for others.
- take risks to boost your immune system.

-- x@realestatetrent*

Employees have no control over their futures. The economy forces all the risk on them.

Hints:

- When you sell your ability to deliver results nobody asks about your skillset. When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need.
- Rich people get paid by project and pay by the hour.
- The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn’t want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn’t get for it, is a failure in his eyes.

"Trade money for time, not time for money. You’re going to run out of time first."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### Specialist or generalist?

<!--
- There’s nothing wrong in specialization - it’s how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don’t have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.
-->

Hints:

- To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.
- To be employed, if you pick the right specialization, you’ll do better as a specialist.
- Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists.

### How to know your strenghts?

Ask employers why did they asked you for an interview - they will describe your strengths.

> *"Your work speaks only to those on the same wavelenght as you."

### On hiring and being hired

<!--
- Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas. In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction". Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.
- hiring questions: sucess history. why did you go that company and why did you left.
- People want freedom to choose their process.
- pro tip: near the end of an interview, tell your interviewers that you want the role
- T ou pi shaped.
- Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.
- Your boss doesn’t care how hard you work. They care how easy you make their job.

> *"He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist."  
-- St. Francis of Assisi [1181]*

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».

Your goal should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are. Leaders must become masters at finding and hiring talent.

Hints:

- When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant. Don’t do interviews, do discussions.
- Employers are just trying to find somebody they like, that’s what «culture fit» is. Often is not how good you are, you just have to be liked while being sufficiently good. Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you. And people like people like themselves.
- Good interview questions:
	- «Problems you’ve solved and how did you solve them?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What did you get done this week?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What do you own and why?» (Sandy Gottesman, investor)
	- «What do you believe that most people don’t?»
	- «Show me your calendar». A lot of detailed stuff is an implementer. (Codie Sanchez)
	- «How to solve this X problem I have right now?» To detect a fast thinker. (Codie Sanchez)
- Remember that I’d hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I’d not have had to hire them. Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
- Companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist. Growing companies are always hiring.
- Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.
- A job search is both a numbers game and a quality game. You can control how many jobs you apply to, and how good your skills and portfolio are.

### On resumes

> *"Your real resume is a painful recounting of all your struggles."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Hints:

- Your resume should tell the reader why you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience. Tell HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person. ie. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.
- There are two skill levels: still learning or confident.

> *"Whatever makes you weird is probably your greatest asset."  
-- Joss Whedon [1964]*

### How to attract and keep talented people?

> *"Everybody wants to hire the best. Few of them actually pay them like they’re the best."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Respect them. You’ll never respect them if you don’t reward them accordingly.

Hints:

- Use «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process. Usually people leave managers, not companies.
- Smart people will not work extremely hard just for money.
- Good employees are not easy to find. It takes some real *chutzpah* to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.
- Asking for a raise. Don’t get discouraged if you get a «no». Simply thank them for their time and ask «What specific outcomes would be required to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?» If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

> *"Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to."

## On relationships

<!--
- Choose people that choose you. The end.
- Loyalty is earned, not owed. If they drain your energy, stunt your growth, or disrespect your boundaries, let them go. You weren’t born to carry dead weight. Protect your peace and move forward.
- Never force, don’t beg and don’t chase.
- One day you’re going to miss how much I cared.
- The more you do for people the less gratitude they show. The more you go out of your way for them to like you, the less appreciative they are of you. too much availability kills your VALUE.
-->

> *"Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Focus on what you can give. However, after taking first steps, mirror their behavior. Don’t cross oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you.

Hints:

- If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.
- If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.
- Trust and vulnerability are correlated. Don’t hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.
- Supporting helps people grow and builds healthy relationships. Fixing manipulates people and builds resentment and/or co-dependency.
- Sometimes connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.

-- vox populi*

> *"Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you."

> *"Play long-term games with long-term people. The secret to a happy relationship is two happy people. If you loose somebody for being yourself, then you never had them to begin with. Find a relationship where you, naturally being you, makes the other person happy and viceversa. The worst way to build a relationship is to try to build a relationship. The people you most want to impress can read your intentions." (...)  
"If you ask someone why they’re with someone else and the answer sounds like a resume, it’s over." (...)  
"Intimacy is a flower - it blooms in a healthy relationship, and disappears in a sick one." (...)

## On family and friends

<!--
> *"Absence, the highest form of presence."  -- James Joyce*

- I love Nietzsche’s definition of friendship, which is "people with whom you share one great suffering and one great hope." You can’t be friends unless you hate the same things and worship the same Gods
- If you look at the people in your circle and don’t get inspired, you don’t have a circle. You have a cage.
- Instead of trying to change people, curate them.
- stay way from people who act like a victim in a problem they created.
- The older you get as a man, the more you understand your father and forgive him for everything.
- The price of growth is outgrowing people.
- The real miracle of Jesus was having 12 close friends in your late 30s
- There are cycles in life. Do not expect people to level up with you. You are not supposed to keep the same friends forever.
- You need friends who inspire you to do better, not acquaintances who tell you what you can’t do.
- Your girlfriend will get a new boyfriend. Your boss will replace you before your burial. But your mum won’t get another son. Take care of her. Your birthday is for your mom, not you.
- your single female friends are the most toxic thing in your relationship DUMP them!
- Your successful friends will leave you behind if you don’t level up too.
-->

> *"True friendship can exist only between equals."  
-- Plato [-427]*

Life is meant to be lived in community but don’t settle for a place where you’re tolerated. Go where you’re celebrated.

Be independent from your family but loyal at the same time. Keep your friends for friendship but work with the skilled and competent. Resist the temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

### How to curate your friends?

> *"Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend’s success."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

You are the average of your friends.

If you’re always the smartest in the room, you’re in the wrong room. When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.

Hints:

- If your absence doesn’t bother them, your presence never mattered.
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are. People who genuinely want the best for you are very rare and they are usually already wealthy, loved and happy.
- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
- You’re never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you. Second step is inviting them to do something. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. You know someone is a friend when you can go long stretches without talking and the talk is right where we left off.
- It’s ok to unfollow people in real life. Don’t let your loneliness tempt you to reconnect with toxic people. You wouldn’t drink poison just because you’re thirsty.
- Pay attention to who you’re with when you feel your best.
- Be suspicious of people who like being owed a favor. Especially if it is not a favor you requested.
- Maintain old friendships. 
- Bad friends will prevent you from having good friends.
- You only grow apart from people who don’t grow.

> *"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you too can become great."

> *"Modern dating is basically learning all about someone until you are no longer attracted to them—sometimes it takes one date, sometimes it takes years."  -- x@signulll*  
> *"Never has anyone done something entirely for others. All love is self-love. Think of those you love: dig deeply and you will see that you do not love them; you love the pleasant sensations that this love produces in you! You love the desire, not the desired." -- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 
> *"Porn has prolonged more marriages than it’s ever destroyed."  -- Rollo Tomasi*
> *"Some advice i gave to my friend: your value as a man should never be reduced to how you look. On dating apps that’s all you are—your height, & your face. It’s an endless police lineup for women to pick from, with nothing else factored in. The apps flattens you into a 2D commodity, judged in milliseconds.

> *"Men dream about virgins. Women dream about monsters. Who’s more perverted?"  -- Rivelino*
> *"Your "loyalty" doesn’t mean anything to her if you can’t get other women. That’s not being loyal, that’s being a loser."  -- Rivelino*

- A man will cry for a woman once in his lifetime. After that, his soul will never allow him to ever trust women (or fully love) ever again.
- Date multiple women, and you’ll never fall in love. Date only one woman, and you’ll lose faith in love.
- I always have this fear that one day you are going to discover that i’m not as great as you once thoght I was.
- I once asked my grandpa: «Why should I not go back to my ex». He replied: «If you see the same tree in the forest twice, it’s because you are lost».
- Men can be easily manipulated by attractive women. Women can be easily manipulated by high status men.
- Men will spend money on women they don’t love, but a woman will never spend money on a man she doesn’t love.
- Porn has ruined men. Social media has ruined women.
- Psycologically the worst feelling is sitting next to a person who means the world you knowing that you men nothing to them.
- she was poetry but he couldn’t read.
- Thank you for not loving me. It forced me to love myself.

> *"We accept the love we think we deserve."  
-- Stephen Chbosky [1970]*

You attract what you are.

Love is what happens to men and women that don’t know each other. Love doesn’t hurt, expectations do. Every person feels loved in a different form.

Hints:

- We fall in love with someone because of how they make us feel about ourselves.
- We’re always looking for somebody that looks for us. First parents, then a lover. Screens give us 100% attention. Tech is a compensation.
- Man’s loyalty is tested when he has everything. Woman’s loyalty is tested when her man has nothing.
- Arguing and insecurity is anti-seductive. Familiarity is the death of seduction.
- Relationships start with «can we talk» to «we need to talk». Once you start disliking someone, everything they do is irritating to you. A dirty dish by the sink can be a big marriage problem.
- Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.

He allows for her to be who she desires to be in his presence. Seduction is about satisfying her desire to feel safe and seen. Mystery is the mistress of desire. Infer how you feel, because things don’t always need to be spelled out clearly. Women want to read between the lines. We fall in love through our minds. If we think about you because we are trying to solve you, our minds will do the work for you.

- I want a man that sees my demons.
- If you’re waiting for a man to get rich before you take him serious, take note. "Men don’t fall in love when they’re rich"
- My man needs to have good social skills. I don’t care how he gets them.

- What men think women want: Looks and money. What women actually need: Leadership, humor, honesty, intelligence, resilience, certainty in their actions.
- Without money only mother can love you.
- Women want to be desired, not because it gives them connection, but because it gives them control.

### What men value in women

<!--
- Men do not care if a woman is an engineer or a doctor. They only care about if she’s loyal, respectful and virgin.
- Men hate disrespect more than they love sex
- Men pick loyal girls over successful ones. Girls pick successful men over loyal ones.
- Young women value themselves based on how much men want to sleep with them, which gives them a false high self valuation. If they valued themselves based on how much men wanted to marry them once they got to know them, they’d have a much more accurate estimation of their worth.

# 2.2 - On competition

## On hierarchy

<!--
> *"If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame.*
> *"No hay prepotencia más ridícula que la que se destila de la creencia de que recopilar talento ajeno es un talento."  -- Jorge Luis Borges [1899]*
> *"technology: belief in competence. Regulation: belief in influence"  -- x@rapahelz*

- be careful what you tolerate. You are teaching people how to treat you
- Call a rich guy poor, and all he will do is smirk. Call a powerful man weak, and all he will do is smirk. Call a charming misogynist a «virgin», and all he will do is smirk. If it affects you, it is true.
- civilized war: please the master and positive relationship with servants. if you appear too ambitious they’ll bring you down.
- How he carries himself is how he will be treated. A man with supreme confidence and self-assurance will be treated like one.
- if you don’t like something, just take away its only power: your attention.
- in any hierarchy there are zealots
- No one cares about you until you win. No one is ever ignoring you, everyone is focused on their goals, and you should be doing the same.
- People don’t fly business class just for the seat. They do it to not have to spend 12 hours with normies. The more money you make the more you realize the barriers to luxury are not just for comfort. But for seperation.
- People like to feel in control. if we try them to get them do something, people feel disempowered. if they feel that somebody is deciding for them they say no when they would be happy to go along.
- people respect who they can’t disrespect. 
- Stop wasting time on fake achievements. Learn to fight, build, or make money. Real men create, not escape.
- Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren’t random or stupid.

Everything is hierarchy. Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

However don’t vow to the gatekeepers. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It’s a business relationship.

#### How to get wealthy without luck

<!--
- I don’t waste time with unpriced listings.
-->

> *"You don’t get rich by spending your time to save money; you get rich by saving your time to make money."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Making money is not about luck. 

- Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you will be unstoppable.
- Equip yourself with specialized knowledge, accountability, and leverage. Specialized knowledge is what you learn uniquely, not through standard education. If society can teach it to you, it can teach it to others, making you replaceable. You acquire specialized knowledge by following your genuine interests, not just current trends. While you might find it enjoyable, others may see it as hard work. This kind of knowledge is usually passed on through apprenticeships, not traditional schooling. It often involves technical or creative expertise that’s difficult to outsource or automate.
- Embrace responsability and take business risks under your own name. In exchange, society might grant you more duties, ownership, and influence. The most accountable people usually have unique, public, and bold personal brands, like Oprah, Trump, Kanye, and Elon.
- Select partners with intelligence, energy, and, above all, integrity. Stay away from cynics and pessimists, as their negative beliefs can become self-fulfilling prophecies.
- To become wealthy, offer what society wants but can’t access easily, and do it at a large scale. Pick an industry for long-term projects with similar-minded people. The internet has opened up diverse career options, yet many haven’t realized this. Focus on persistent efforts. In life, the most substantial gains come from building on past progress. Money is a tool for trading experiences. Create valuable experiences to build your wealth.
- Prioritize building wealth instead of chasing money or status. Wealth involves owning assets that generate income without constant effort. Understand that it’s possible to create wealth ethically. Don’t pay attention to those who focus on status games; they often gain status by criticizing wealth builders. Money is a sensitive topic as many tie their self-worth and identity to their jobs and earnings, reflecting their skills and competence in the market. 
- You won’t achieve significant wealth by simply trading your time for money. To attain financial freedom, you must have ownership or equity in a business or venture. You’re spending time to save money when you should be spending money to save time.
- When you eventually attain wealth, you will realize that it wasn’t your primary pursuit in the first place. Free wealth: Books, friends, sleep, ideas, questions, gratefulness, laugh.
- Being broke is hard. Becoming rich is hard. Choose your hard.

> *"I succeeded because I have a long attention span. (...)  
"Waiting helps you as an investor, and a lot of people just can’t stand to wait."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

The secret of healthy finances is not to make more money but to keep some.

Hints:

- Diversify with uncorrelated investment bets (barbell strategy).
- Spend less than you make. Saving 10% of all paychecks is a good start. Keep some liquidity, avoid investing in anything you can’t sell in a month or two.
- Modern slaves are not chains, they are debt. Ultimately is about the total cost of the mortgage. That is the price of the home. The closing price is an illusion. Today, people with moderate incomes, are forced to speculate or live in poverty.

### On investment comfort zone

> *"When forced to choose, I will not trade even a night’s sleep for the chance of extra profits."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Scared money never wins. It’s all about the risk of losing money versus the risk of missing opportunity. 

> *"The safest way to double your money is to fold it over once and put it in your pocket."  
-- Kin Hubbard [1868]*

-- x@morganhousel*

#### How to spot good investments?

> *"It’s not what you buy. It’s what you pay. There is no asset which is so good that it can’t be overpriced and very few assets which are so bad that they can’t be underpriced. How do you get low price to value? The answer is low optimism."  
-- Howard Marks [1946]*

What’s my religion? Arbitrage and rents.

Hints:

- What’s going to stay the same in the next ten years. While boring, offer the best investment opportunities.
- Where is low optimism. Recessions are caused when a bunch of people lose confidence all at once.
- Know who are the buyers, the sellers and their motivations.
- Investments are competing with each other.
- The best companies aren’t sold, they’re bought. Stay away from junk stocks.
- The more you know, the less you need to diversify. Diversification is an hedge against lack of knowledge.
- Take risk from the table whenever possible.
- Don’t buy on future hopes, buy on past mistakes. We don’t loose money on star businesses, we loose money on businesses we think will be star businesses.
- Good investors don’t sell investment advice and not talk about their returns.

"What an investor needs is the ability to correctly evaluate selected businesses. Note that word “selected”: You don’t have to be an expert on every company, or even many.

### On popularity

> *"There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses."  
-- Bjarne Stroustrup*

See fame as a multiplier. 

People say they want to be famous to impact the world, often what they want is the adoration of their peers.
Don’t strive to be well-known, strive to be worth knowing.

> *"He who is known as an early riser need not get up until noon." (...)

"You want to be rich and anonymous, not poor and famous." (...)  
"Venture funds sell brand for the right to invest money." (...)

-->

> *"If cats looked like frogs we’d realize what nasty, cruel little bastards they are. Style. That’s what people remember."  
-- Terry Pratchett [1948]*

A beautiful person always see beauty in others. Beauty grabs attention. Personality grabs the heart.

-- vox populi*

> *"Clothes make the man. Naked people have little or no influence on society."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"The only thing more mysteriously attractive than beauty is corruption."

-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Dress shabbily and they remember the dress; dress impeccably and they remember the woman."  
-- Coco Chanel [1883]*

> *"Elegance is a physical quality. If a woman doesn’t have it naked, she’ll never have it clothed."  
-- Karl Lagerfeld [1933]*

> *"Beauty needs a witness. This the only thing a man ever needs to know."  
-- Zan Perrion [1964]*

### On health

<!--
- a sedentary lifestyle is a magnet for depression.
- A women is either a 0 or a 1. A hore or a wife material. Dont overcomplicate.
- Depression and schizophrenia are so tied to poor gut bacteria that researchers can identify a person with depression just by analyzing their gut bacteria composition.
- Pain changes people. Some become rude. Some become silent.
-->

> *"The secret to living well and longer is: eat half, walk double, laugh triple and love without measure."  
-- vox populi*

Health is also an envy trigger. Often what people really envy is self-control.

#### How to stay healthy?

- Exercise is king. Balance on body training is training flexibility (yoga or animal movements) and strength (weights). Minimum effective dose.
- Nutrition is queen. Eat more real foods and practice intermittent fasting.
- Follow your circadian rhythm. If you need an alarm clock to get you started mornings, you are cheating yourself on rest. Memories need sleep to get consolidated.

> *"The food you eat can either be the safest and most powerful form of medicine or the slowest form of poison."  
-- Ann Wigmore [1909]*

> *"Modern lifestyles weaken the body. Modern psychology weakens the mind."

> *"Calm the stomach. Move the body. Rest the mind." (...)  
"The modern mind is overstimulated and the modern body is understimulated and overfed. Meditation, exercise, and fasting restore an ancient balance."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Take better care of your health when you are already healthy. Keep investing when you are already financially secure. Find a better job when you already have a job. Take bigger risks when you don’t need to take any. Build meaningful relationships when you are already happy alone."

> *"Give me a museum and I’ll fill it."  -- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

- clutter is just a museum of shit you thought would make you happy.
- Hit the gym. Avoid drama. Smell nice. Make money. Level up your circle. Talk less. Pray more. Think highly of yourself.
- I much prefer the riches I had - anonymity, freedom, simplicity - to those they have today - technology driven constant connectedness, ultra convenient (but awful) food, instant entertainment. It’s the difference between a vigorous independent youth and one scheduled and managed by the predominant culture. I prefer the former.
- If you’re from a poor background, entertainment is your enemy. That sh!t will keep you poor
- look around, all that clutter used to be money
- never before has a generation so diligently recorded themselves accomplishing so little.
- Owning less is better than organising more. Eliminate instead of organize.
- Poor people spend to be seen. Wealthy people spend to be invisible.
- Sex, sun, rest, exercise, diet, self-respect, real friends, money, gratitude, discipline, laughter, purpose, peace of mind., mental clarity, purpose, gratitude, meditation, growth, time in nature.
- some people want a big house, a fast car and lots of money. some people want a tiny cabin in the woods away from those kinds of people.
- watching sports is «by definition» NPC behavior
- what’s your adrenaline type? velocidade ou fronteira do conhecido.
- When you watch sports on TV, you are watching other men live out their dreams while you doing nothing for your own dreams. You are a Dream Cuck.
- You don’t have to be rich to start living the life you want. Most people were just brainwashed into thinking that they wanted a luxurious, expensive lifestyle. A happy life tends to be much simpler: a healthy body, a mind at peace, a loving family, time to do what you love.

> *"I think I’m greedy, but I’m not greedy for money - I think that can be a burden - I’m greedy for an exciting life."  
-- David Hockney [1937]*

It’s okay to live a life others don’t understand. 

We were designed to walk dozens of miles each day, catch our own meals, live in a close-knit tribe, have regular sex, raise children and die. When life becomes about enjoying every second over accumulating more stuff, we are able to live lives of true abundance and joy.

Hints:

- Build a business with the heuristic of «maximize my vacation time». You will often be presented with two options: the lucrative option and the lifestyle option. 
- Aspire to work 3 days a week; 3 weeks a month; 3 months free a year.
- Aspire to move past room-mates, commutes, alarm clocks and calendars. (Naval Ravikant)
- Own my house on a few acres with clean water river frontage, and assets I can enjoy & be creative with (car, bike, music equipment, tools, etc)  
- How to reduce your expenses without sacrificing your quality of life? Geoarbitrage. Car: max 10K. Job: live next to it. Income doesn’t make you rich. spending habits do.
- The opposite of play isn’t work, it’s depression. Create a life you don’t need a vacation from. Making money in order to consume goods can’t mankinds’s sole purpose on this planet.
- 3 hobbies: one creative, one to keep in shape and one to make money.
- House + work + third place. We drink to loosen our tongues. Feel like a local celebrity: everybody knows who you are.
- I have no plans to retire. It’s the perfect combination of work and play that keep you young.
- You can never be over dressed or over educated but avoid clothing that are more interesting than you are.
- Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

#### On travel

> *"Because in the end, you won’t remember the time you spent working in the office or mowing your lawn. Climb that goddamn mountain."  
-- Jack Kerouac [1922]*

Travel is the only thing you buy that makes you richer. Travels are mini-lifes. They solve a plethora of self-improvement goals. 

Hints:

- Travelling is getting under the skin of the place.
- Think less about money optimization and more about who you’re going with.
- Travellers are the best money managers. People have a cultural memory of travelling as expensive but it’s not. Just buy a ticket to the next destination, look for empty seats and get people to take you home.
- Choose places with «lifers»: people who are dedicated to the business itself, not to a paycheck.

> *"What gives value to travel is fear."  
-- Albert Camus [1913]*

### On success

> *"Success doesn’t come to you. You go to it."  
-- Marva Collins [1936]*

There is no shortcut. Success is nothing but the accumulation of small things done consistently over a long period. Succeeding means securing advantage.

	SUCCESS = EDUCATION + ACTION

Success (and happiness) is internal not external. True fulfillment comes from living not from achievement. Experiences worth more than material. When people finally became a «success» they realize that they were no more fulfilled at 40 with $100K in the bank and a BMW in the garage than they were flipping burgers at the age of 20 with only $10 to their name. They spent so much time, money, and energy in pursuit of something that didn’t really matter to them.

Hints:

- The true measure of success is a calm nervous system.
- Success is a collection of well curated failures.
- The most successful people are those who are good at plan b.

> *"Success lies in relentless execution of the basics."  
-- Leonardo Da Vinci [1452]*

> *"I failed my way to success."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

> *"A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and gets to bed at night, and in between he does what he wants to do." (...)  
"Success is the ability to go from one failure to another with no loss of enthusiasm."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"The way to succeed is to double your failure rate."  
-- Thomas John Watson Sr. [1874]*

> *"Strive not to be a success, but rather be of value."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"To me success has meant just two things: a good life for my family, and the money to buy books and continue the education of this wandering man."  
-- Louis L’amour [1908]*

> *"Success is peace of mind which is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best you are capable of becoming."  
-- John Wooden [1910]*

> *"Most overnight successes take at least 5 years. Budget your life accordingly." (...)

-- Bill Gates [1955]*

> *"The secret to success is retaining your child-like qualities."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"Anything that is successful is a series of mistakes."  
-- Billie Armstrong [1972]*

> *"The success formula: solve your own problems and freely share the solutions." (...)  
"The price of growth is outgrowing people." (...)  
"Predicting failure is easier than predicting success." (...)  
"If you could literally just sit for 30 minutes and be happy, you are successful."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Want to get ahead in life? Start genuinely rooting for others to succeed. It’s as simple as that."  
-- Sahil Bloom [1991]*

> *"Your current results are just the visible output of your old decisions compounding over time. But since people evaluate based on short-term signals, they often misinterpret whether something is actually working. This is why so many businesses & individuals chase surface level metrics instead of real durable progress. Early effort often leads to decline before real takeoff, but most people quit before the inflection point."  
-- x@signulll*

#### On barriers to success

> *"Whether you think you can, or you think you can’t, you’re right."  
-- Henry Ford [1863]*

Fear, not failure, is the biggest barrier to success. Some people are terrified of success, they may be forced to buy a suit.

We don’t get successful by knowing everything, we get successful by listening.

> *"Success and rest don’t sleep together."  
-- vox populi*

> *"If you want to be successful, you must respect one rule – never lie to yourself."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

> *"If you didn’t get what do you want, it’s a sign that you didn’t really wanted it or you bargained the price."  
-- Robert Kiyosaki [1947]*

> *"There is no formula for success, but there are two formulas for failure: not trying and not persisting."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Nothing is more common than unsuccessful people with talent. Leave the house before you find something worth staying in for."  
-- Banksy [1974]*

> *"Doubt kills more dreams than failure ever will."  
-- Suzy Kassem [1975]*

> *"The most successful people I know believe in themselves almost to the point of delusion."  
-- Sam Altman [1985]*






## On conflicts

> *"War is what happens when language fails."  
-- Margaret Atwood [1939]*

Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it. Rotten peace builds resentment.

Small (but relevant) conflicts will grow into big conflicts. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship.

> *"War spares not the brave, but the cowardly."  
-- Anacreon [-573]*

-- Desiderius Erasmus [1466]*

-- Benjamin Disraeli [1804]*

> *"You cannot find peace by avoiding life."  
-- Virginia Woolf [1882]*

> *"At the core of every major conflict between human beings there is a trust problem."  
-- x@rapahelz*

### On conflict resolution

> *"In college I used to work on the conflict resolution team at a local concert venue. Ultimate tool to de-escalate almost any situation? A genuine smile."  -- x@realestatetrent*

You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Hints:

- Use «we». Mean it and take responsability.
- Bring options to the table. It’s easier to negotiate down.

> *"A quarrel is quickly settled when deserted by one party; there is no battle unless there be two."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

> *"If they are wise, do not quarrel with them; if they are fools, ignore them."

And those are pointless if they can’t be backed up by violence. If you don’t have your own ability to inflict violence, it will be taken away from you. One recent tweet I had said, “The right to vote does not give you power. Power gives you the right to vote." You can just do a simple thought exercise: If there were a hundred of us on a desert island and we’re trapped, and we all kind of have to cooperate to create a new society. Suppose there are 10 people on the island who are all from the same ethnic background, who are all extremely unified, and they have all the guns. Those 10 have it, the other 90 don’t. Who do you think is going to end up running the place “for the benefit of the others"? Anyone who’s been around the block a few times knows what’s going to happen. So it’s just the nature of humans that if you want freedom at the individual level, if you want the rights to be dispersed and distributed, the power has to be dispersed and distributed. And there’s very few institutions and organizations that do that. Really, it’s the right to bear arms, cryptography, free speech, mathematics, personal computing. These are examples of decentralized technologies and capabilities that spread power amongst people. Most things concentrate power."  -- x@naval*

> *"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."*
And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.
But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.
Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.
The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.

> *"For the friends: everything. For the others: the law."  
-- Niccoló Machiavelli {paraphrased} [1469]*

Politicians hate risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending people, specially their voters.

Hints:

- Politicians don’t get educated, they get bought.
- The opposite of corruption is patriotism. To reduce corruption diminish people involved on analogic processes.
- Taxes are a membership fee that most of us are voluntarily overpaying.
- Inequality is a problem. Equality is not the solution. That’s the dilemma.
- Changes from within are more sustainable than revolutions. We don’t need great individuals, we need institutions that work.
- Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.
- The moment you cross a second border, you are an economic migrant, not a refugee.
- Multicultural is by absurdum the true monocultural.

> *"Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

Society is run by peer pressure, not intelligence.

Most people are other people. People accept the defaults very easily. Our thoughts are someone else opinions and we jump to conclusions. Our insecurities drive us to excess and overcompensation. We are, at heart, animals and we are easily manipulated, especially in groups.

Groups of people behave differently than individuals. The larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. This effect is known as mob behaviour. This is also why individuals should make decisions. Groups never admit failure.

### On stupidity

> *"Stupidity is overlooking or dismissing crucial information."  
-- Adam Robinson [1955]*

Stupidity is the cost of intelligence operating in a complex environment and it’s almost inevitable. Most people don’t actually think, they just take their first thought and go. There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default. That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!», it means they’ve stopped thinking.

### How to judge someone?

<!--
- your perception of me is a reflection of you
-->

> *"Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

We judge ourselves by our thoughts but society judges us by what we can do for them.

Hints:

- When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability.
- Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.
- Judge people on their habits.

## On science

<!--
- athenian and italian city states and free form usa were hotbeds for innovation. there was lot of competition.
- enlightment was a revolution in how people sought knowledge : by trying not to rely on authorithy.
- future proof by avoiding dedicated hardware
- if you cannot question it, it’s not science, it’s propaganda.
- look at ideas individually not at the ism
- making something social destroys truth of it because social groups need consensus to survive - otherwise they fight and can’t get along - and consensus is all about truth seeking.
- Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on.
- science transforms raw materials (resources) into civilization.
- social sciences need to appeal to society for funding so they are politically motivated.
- the real diversity that matters is diversity of ideas not diversity of skin color.
- the world as your lab. if you do stuff scientifically you can do it right next time also
- theories are explanations, not predictions. prediction comes after the explanation
- theories are not derived from anything. human minds crete them by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing ideias. we guess.
- trust the science is the most anti-science statement ever. questioning science is how you do science.
- wild west, the frontire is always filled with crime and scams and weid stuff and people but it’s where innovation occurs also.

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it’s a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .
3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.
4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.
7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.
8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.
9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.
10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.
11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.
12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.
13. Design is based on requirements. There’s no justification for designing something one bit "better" than the requirements dictate.
16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.
17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.
20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.
23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.
27. (Varsi’s Law) Schedules only move in one direction.
29. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.
30. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist’s concept.
31. (Mo’s Law of Evolutionary Development) You can’t get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.
32. (Atkin’s Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don’t show up.
33. (Patton’s Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
34. (Roosevelt’s Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
35. (de Saint-Exupery’s Law of Design) A designer knows that they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
37. (Henshaw’s Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame.
40. (McBryan’s Law) You can’t make it better until you make it work.

"The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

Science is the study of truth. Science is about disproving, not proving. Everything that is not a law of nature is just a shared belief. Technology is applied science.

## On maths and computers

<!--
- 90% of webapps are database frontends. - Anytime machine learning is working quietly in the background, it almost always shows up as a feed in the front-end design
- hash is a fingerprint of an amount of information. SHA256 -> 64 characters
- Top dev skills: Ability to ignore new tools and technologies; Taste for simplicity; Good code deletion skills; Humility.
- There is no cloud. It’s just someone else’s computer. / a fundamental rule of technology: There is no third ecosystem
- blockchains are not personal-computing operational systems; they are social systems.
- chatgpt is a blurry jpeg of the web. openai chatbot offers paraphrases, whereas google offers quotes. which do we prefer. llms are essentially connection machines trained to find the linkages between concepts. ai is like an autocorrect system on steroids.
