# 2.1 - On interaction

## On communication

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

Speak less and listen more. Listening is powerful.

> *'Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.' -- Jimi Hendrix*

> *'When you listen, you may learn something new.' -- Dalai Lama*

### How to communicate? 

<!--
- be autentic offer good energy, be human, build rapport, listen, humbleness, genuine appreciation. How to make a good first impression: putting your best foot forward actually reveals the real you.
- Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day. The point is to move what’s exciting you to the top of your mental list so you’re ready to go if an opportunity presents.
-->

- Smile and relax. Stop trying to impress. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people smile more than other people. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Learn how to lessen the crushing pressure of being interesting by focusing on being interested: controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and it will appear as fake.
- Listen. Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Don’t worry about what you’re going to say next. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. Be interested to be interesting, Want to be the most interesting person in the room? Learn the art of active listening. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..  
	- Mirroring: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question. (Yes, it’s that simple.)
	- Paraphrasing: Repeat what they just said in your own words.
	- Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.
- Get better at asking questions, they are more important than answers. But you must be curious, asking questions without paying attention is worthless. Making good/unusual questions will make people interested in you. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It’s hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Be interested to be interesting.
- Banish meaningless small talk and learn how to ask questions that build rapport and natural conversation. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Build rapport, cut the BS. Speak what’s in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet. Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but crucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments or asking for advice.
- Don’t be stubborn: you don’t always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don’t judge. Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. No one is inherently boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions.

> *'Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### How to tell good stories?

Good stories condense a massive amount of details into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment. When it is accurate, it’s only accurate to the extent that the story requires in order to remain relevant.

> *'Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out.' -- Alfred Hitchcock*

> *'The more you say, the less people remember.' -- François Fénelon*

### How to discord?

Listen as you’re wrong.

Ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. If they can explain why they are correct, you'll learn something. If they can't you'll soften their views.

- «Will you tell me your story? I’d love to know how you came to this point of view. It sounds like I could learn something.»  

> *'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' -- Mark Twain*


### On public speaking

You don't need to answer their question.

- You can say whatever you want if it's interesting.
- Know when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions.
- Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of desagreeing.

> *'Always say less than necessary.' -- Kevin Kelly*




---
## On conflicts

> *'War is what happens when language fails.' -- Margaret Atwood*

> *'Your best response to an insult is “You’re probably right.” Often they are.' -- Kevin Kelly*

Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it. Rotten peace builds resentment.

Don’t avoid relevant conflicts. Small (but relevant) conflicts will grow into big conflicts. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship.

### On conflict resolution

You're either part of the solution or part of the problem.

- Show empathy by using «we». Mean it and take responsability.
- Bring options to the table. It’s easier to negotiate down.

> *'To quiet a crowd or a drunk, just whisper.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Calm is contagious.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Think before you speak. There is always time to add a word, never to withdraw one. Talk as if you were making your will: the fewer words the less litigation.' -- Balthasar Gracian*




---
## On criticism and envy

<!--
- Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.
-->

> *'Great spirits have always found violent opposition from mediocrities. The latter cannot understand it when a man does not thoughtlessly submit to hereditary prejudices but honestly and courageously uses his intelligence.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events. Small minds discuss people.' -- Henry Thomas Buckle*

Treat haters like toddlers.

Outliers inspire envy. Once they stop talking to you, they start talking about you. [Intelligence](chapter_appendix.md#on-intelligence), [wealth](chapter_appendix.md#on-wealth), [ambition](chapter_appendix.md#on-ambition-and-motivation), [fame](chapter_appendix.md#on-fame), [luck](chapter_appendix.md#on-luck), [beauty](chapter_appendix.md#on-beauty), [health](chapter_appendix.md#on-stress-and-health), freedom and a mix of them ([lifestyle](chapter_appendix.md#on-lifestyle)) are the main triggers.

> *'Remember if people talk behind your back, it only means you are two steps ahead.' -- Fannie Flagg*

> *'They called her witch because she knew how to heal herself.' -- Te' V. Smith (Here we are, reflections of a God gone mad)*

> *'Think as you like but behave like others.'  
'Never appear too perfect.' -- Robert Greene (38th and 46th laws of power)*

> *'If A is a success in life, then A = X + Y + Z. Work is X; Y is play; and Z is keeping your mouth shut.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Success makes so many people hate you. I wish it wasn’t that way. It would be wonderful to enjoy success without seeing envy in the eyes of those around you.' -- Marilyn Monroe*

When people criticize your life they are speaking about their fears and limitations not yours. Only take advice from [those achieving what you want to achieve](chapter_3_action.md##on-feedback-and-mentorship). Ignore and be flattered by the rest. Never hate people who are jealous of you. Respect their jealousy, they think that you’re better than them.

> *'The dogs bark but the caravan moves on.' -- Arab proverb*  

> *'It is not greed that drives the world, but envy.' -- Warren Buffet*

### On blindspots

However beware of blindspots, not all criticism is envy. When somebody says something bad about you, is negativity. When everyone says it, is advice.

> *'Let me never fall into the vulgar mistake of dreaming that I am persecuted whenever I am contradicted.' -- Ralph Waldo Emerson*

## On following the herd

<!--
> *'When someone tells you something is wrong, they’re usually right. When someone tells you how to fix it, they’re usually wrong.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

> *'Everyone is born a genius, but the process of living de-geniuses them.' -- Buckminster Fuller*

> *'Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean.' -- Charlie Munger*

Most people are other people. Changing course is hard and this scares us so we look around and try to copy the courses other people took. Their thoughts are someone else opinions and they jump to conclusions. People accept the defaults very easily.

Psychologists have known for a long time that groups of people behave differently than individuals. Sometimes when we are in a group, we tend to be less inhibited, more rebellious, and more confident. This effect is known as mob behaviour. As a general rule, the larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. This is also why individuals and not groups should make decisions. Groups never admit failure.

Freud was the one who realized that people’s insecurities drove them to excess and overcompensation. Freud was also the one who understood that people are, at heart, animals and are easily manipulated, especially in groups.

> *'My first thought, is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I’ve already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom.' -- William Deresiewicz*

> *'Whenever people agree with me I always feel I must be wrong.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. '-- Bertrand Russell*

> *'In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations and epochs, it is the rule.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *'And those who were seen dancing were thought to be insane by those who could not hear the music.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *'Common sense is the collection of prejudices acquired by age eighteen.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Gold rushes make the shovel sellers rich, not the gold seekers.'*

> *'Just because people tell you it can’t be done, that doesn’t necessarily mean that it can’t be done. It just means that they can’t do it.' -- Anders Hejlsberg*

### On stupidity

> *'Stupidity is overlooking or dismissing crucial information.' -- Adam Robinson*

Stupidity is the cost of intelligence operating in a complex environment and it’s almost inevitable. Most people don’t actually think, they just take their first thought and go. There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default. That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!», it means they’ve stopped thinking.

> *'When a wise man points at the moon, the imbecile examines the finger.' -- Confucius*

> *'Talk sense to a fool and he calls you foolish.' -- Euripides*

> *'Nothing is more terrible than to see ignorance in action.' -- Goethe*

> *'Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect.' -- Hanlon’s Razor*

> *'I have long held that stupidity is very largely the result of fear leading to mental inhibitions.' -- Bertie Russell*

> *'I find for myself that my first thought is never my best thought. My first thought is always someone else’s; it’s always what I've already heard about the subject, always the conventional wisdom.' -- William Deresiewicz*

> *'If everybody is thinking alike, then somebody isn’t thinking.' -- George S. Patton Jr.*

> *'When you do as everyone else does, don’t be surprised when you get what everyone else gets.' -- Peter Kaufman*

> *'Great things are not accomplished by those who yield to trends and fads and popular opinion.' -- Jack Kerouac*

It's easier to recognise stupidity in others than ourselves but don’t take for granted that others are acting stupid. Common sense is not so common.

> *'Don’t ever take a fence down until you know the reason why it was put up.' -- John F. Kennedy, paraphrasing G.K.Chesterton*

> *'Two economists are walking along the street, and one says, «Hey, someone dropped a $20 bill!» and the other says, «Well, it can’t be a real $20 bill because someone would have picked it up already.»'*

> *'Even a foolish person can still be right about most things. Most conventional wisdom is true.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Every person you meet knows an amazing lot about something you know virtually nothing about. Your job is to discover what it is, and it won’t be obvious.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'You can reduce the annoyance of someone’s stupid belief by increasing your understanding of why they believe it.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### How to judge a man?

> *'Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers.' -- Voltaire*

> *'We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started.' -- Henry Ward Beecher*

We judge ourselves by our thoughts but society judges us by what we can do for them. 

Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.

> *'It isn’t what we say or think that defines us, but what we do.' -- Jane Austen*

# 2.2 - On cooperation

## On relationships

> *'Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.' -- Kevin kelly*

Focus on what you can give. You'll receive in proportion to what you give.  

However, after taking first steps, [mirror](chapter_3_action.md#on-mirroring) their behavior. There comes a time when you have to stop crossing oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you. Partner with people who wants you to be all you can be.

> *'Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you.' -- Dream Hampton*

Hints:

- Trust and vulnerability are correlated. Don’t hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.
- If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.  
- If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.  
- Sometimes connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.

## On lovers

<!--
- Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.
-->

> *'We accept the love we think we deserve.' -- Stephen Chbosky*

You attract what you are.

Love is what happens to men and women that don’t know each other. Love doesn’t hurt, expectations do. Every person feels loved in a different form.

> *'Romance is the glamour which turns the dust of everyday life into a golden haze.' -- Elinor Glyn*

> *'The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned' -- W. Somerset Maugham*  

> *'Love me when I least deserve it, because that’s when I really need it.' -- Swedish proverb*

> *'That’s what careless words do. They make people love you a little less.' -- Arundhati Roy*

> *'It gives me strength to have somebody to fight for; I can never fight for myself, but, for others, I can kill.' -- Emilie Autumn*

> *'The free soul is rare, but you know it when you see it basically because you feel good, very good, when you are near or with them.' -- Charles Bukowski*

First you see the virtues. Then the flaws. For a long and deep relationship, values must match.

> *'Our story has three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. And although this is the way all stories unfold, I still can’t believe that ours didn’t go on forever.' -- Nicholas Sparks*

> *'Men experience many passions in a lifetime. One passion drives away the one before it.' -- Paul Newman*

## On family and friends

<!--
- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.”
- the way of man is the way of the gang

> *'People come, people go – they’ll drift in and out of your life, almost like characters in a favorite book. When you finally close the cover, the characters have told their story and you start up again with another book, complete with new characters and adventures. Then you find yourself focusing on the new ones, not the ones from the past.' -- Nicholas Sparks*
> *'Respect was invented to cover the empty place where love should be.' -- Leo Tolstoy*
-->

> *'When everything goes to hell, the people who stand by you without flinching, they are your family.' -- Jim Butcher*

> *'Your friends are the ones that go to your funeral in a day of rain.' -- an old General*

Life is meant to be lived in community.

Cleave from your family but come back. You need to be independent and loyal at the same time.

> *'Really great people make you feel that you too can be great.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'To lose one parent may be regarded as a misfortune; to lose both looks like carelessness.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Our mothers always remain the strangest, craziest people we've ever met.' -- Marguerite Duras*

### On friends

> *'It is easier to forgive an enemy than to forgive a friend.' -- William Blake*

> *'When you’re in jail, a good friend will be trying to bail you out. A best friend will be in the cell next to you saying, «Damn, that was fun».' -- Groucho Marx*

Resist the temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee.

Keep your friends for friendship, work with the skilled and competent. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

> *'Friendships change. Trust the friends of today as if they will be enemies tomorrow, and that of the worst kind. As this happens in reality, let it happen in your precaution.' -- Balthasar Gracian 26th*

> *'Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend’s success.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'Don’t make a man feel too indebted to you. With many persons it is not necessary to do more than overburden them with favours to lose them altogether: they cannot repay you, and so they retire, preferring rather to be enemies than perpetual debtors.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

> *'Each time you reach out to people, bring them a blessing; then they’ll be happy to see you when you bring them a problem.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Show me your calendar and I will tell you your priorities. Tell me who your friends are, and I’ll tell you where you’re going.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### How to build your «board of directors»?

Curate somehow those who surround you: you are the average of them. When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite. If you’re always the smartest in the room, you’re in the wrong room.

<!--
“A lot of people won’t do that,” says Aaron. “A lot of people say, ‘Hey, I’m going to keep you at arm’s length; I’m not going to share things where I struggle. I’m not going to share with you that I don’t know what I’m talking about.’ See, I ask a lot of questions…I don’t allow my pride or ego to get in the way, because strength starts at the base. You’ve got to let the veil down. You’ve got to be transparent. You’ve got to be vulnerable. That’s why I’ve been in mastermind groups for twenty years. Without those guys, I don’t know where I would be. These guys have different lenses. They have different filters.
“You only have one life experience. You can only see things one way. No matter how hard you try, you’ve only got one filter and one life experience by which to determine. But when you surround yourself with people that don’t have anything to gain or lose -- non-biased people -- they have different life experiences. They have different filters. They can say, ‘You know what? I’ve done that before and life teaches me this.’ Or, ‘I’ve done that before and it sounds good in the textbook, but in reality, this is the way.’
-->

- Surround yourself with people who are achieving on a higher level than you who are willing to call you out on your failures and lift you up for your successes. Once you build this infrastructure of support and accountability, your life will radically transform. If you spend the majority of your time in worlds where people are accomplishing incredible things, all of a sudden that starts to seem normal. I can maybe look foolish or silly in that group, but it protects me from looking silly and foolish out in the world.
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are.
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
we choose friends by proximity, not how do we feel around them, is him as invested in my well being than i am in his. focus in others people sucess but pick the right people.

You’re never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you. Second step is inviting them to do something. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. You know someone is a friend when you can go long stretches without talking and the talk is right where we left off.

> *'Don’t be the smartest person in the room. Hangout with, and learn from, people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you, too, can become great.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On society and politics

<!--
- we don't undertstand suffering very well. sufffering is individual. nations or corporations don't suffer.
- opposite of corruption is patriotism! Changes from within is more sustainable than revolutions. we don't need individuals we need institutions that work.
- social contracts: public promises. Everything is a contract!
> *'A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.'*
> *'History is a race between education and catastrophe.' -- H.G. Wells*

As humans, we are tribal by nature. Our natural default is to see ourselves as part of some group that’s struggling against some other group(s) at all times. And once we’re part of our little group, our little tribe, we adopt all sorts of biases and preferences. We construct belief systems that justify our group’s power and superiority. We create tests of whether other people are “true” and “pure” members of our group, and we either shame any “non-believers” into conformity or simply expel them from the tribe.
Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.
But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.
The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.
And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.
-->

> *'For the friends: everything. For the others: the law.' -- paraphrased from Machiavelli*

Politicians hate risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending people.

To reduce corruption diminish people involved on analogic processes. Politicians don’t get educated, they get bought.

> *'Favors granted always become defined as rights.' -- Saul Alinsky*

> *'To be successful, society must maintain a balance between nurturing excellence and encouraging the average to improve. There must be both cooperation and competition between people in the same society. There is a continual need to balance between a successful, competitive society, and a cohesive, compassionate one.'*

> *'Justice will not be served until those who are unaffected are as outraged as those who are.' -- Benjamin Franklin*

> *'I love individuals. I hate groups of people. I hate a group of people with a «common purpose». Because pretty soon they have little hats. And armbands. And fight songs. And a list of people they’re going to visit at 3am. So, I dislike and despise groups of people. But I love individuals.' -- George Carlin*

> *'The smart way to keep people passive and obedient is to strictly limit the spectrum of acceptable opinion, but allow very lively debate within that spectrum.' -- Noam Chomsky*

> *'When a Democrat is elected, buy gun and ammo stocks. When a Republican is elected, buy newspaper stocks.'*

> *'Good fences make good neighbors.'*

> *'The moment you cross a second border, you are an economic migrant, not a refugee.'*

Multicultural is by absurdum the true monocultural.

> *'Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance, and it is especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance. It presents itself as fairness, yet attempts to restrict and control people's language with strict codes and rigid rules.' -- George Carlin*

<!--
> *'Não há direitos sem obrigações e viceversa.' -- EF*
Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

And they absolutely suck at giving first chances to the right people. Investors just sit there and assume that the right people will find them, but they don’t. The right people are too busy working to be chasing down investors 24/7.

It’s not about what you know, it’s about who trusts you to solve their problems. Often, that requires the technical skills. Always, that requires the communication skills to persuade someone you can do it.

Validate your business by finding paying clients. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. The more they pay, the more they value it - the consumer votes with his wallet.

### On entrepreneurship

<!--
- What one piece of advice would you give someone starting a company?
Do something that most people think is hard. If you try something easy, there will be five other companies doing the same thing two months later. But if you try something that’s difficult at first, everything gets much easier as soon as you make it through those initial challenges. Competition will be lower, because everyone else thought it was too hard. Recruiting good people will be easier, because good people like doing hard things. And when you have better people and less competition, raising capital gets easier, too. -- david velez, nubank
-->

Patterns of unsuccessful entrepreneurs:

- To talk to people but never build anything.
- To build something without first talking to people and trying to sell it.

Hints:

- Do things manually at first. Get one client and do everything the hard way. Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want. Only after you are over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. 
- If you have an idea, test it and launch now. It’s called putting out a “minimally viable product” or MVP. Timing is the most important factor in startup success (quick to start but not the first). Team and Execution came next. Find the 80/20 solution. Don’t put a bunch of effort in on the front end to find out there’s no paying demand. 
- The bottleneck for success often is not knowledge of the tools, but lack of understanding of the customer needs. It’s easier when YOU are the customer. You truly understand the problem. Start with something you’re interested in. Don’t worry about the theory, focus on solving the problem. Fall in love with the problem, not the solution. However «scratching your own itch» it’s good only as a start. Build something people want: Find 10-100 customers who love your product.
- Focus on revenue generating activities: if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it. If there are tasks that need to be done that do not directly result in the generation of revenue, then outsource them so that you have more time to work on building your cash flow.  
- Kill a lot of ideas and create a culture that rewards killing ideas. Nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something, we saved a lot of money.
- Deliver a little bit more than expected. That'll help to get you some recommendations.
- Say "No" to nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients. Avoid: long negotiated deals with big customers if you can. Fire customers that cause you to much stress or that cost too much to service.
- In some complex and mature markets if you start too small you will never be able to compete with existent players. «Starting up in a garage» works mostly on new and undeveloped markets.  
- Be cautious. Entrepreneurs normally take a big risk and offset it with cautious moves (e.g. day job). Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population. Entrepreneurs prepare for bad. They budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.
- There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is FALSE. Study your failures.  
- Most companies don’t die because they run out of money.  
- The biggest assumption I ever made in business is that most people are telling me the truth.

If you build something that people say they'll pay for and then they don’t then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn’t make you a «wannapreneur». At that point it’s just part of the struggle.

<!--
- In Zero to One, Peter Thiel describes how PayPal achieved the critical mass of users needed for it to be useful:
For PayPal to work, we needed to attract a critical mass of at least a million users. Advertising was too ineffective to justify the cost. Prospective deals with big banks kept falling through. So we decided to pay people to sign up. We gave new customers $10 for joining, and we gave them $10 more every time they referred a friend. This got us hundreds of thousands of new customers and an exponential growth rate.
- There is a golden rule, long cherished by restaurateurs, for determining whether a business is viable. Rent should take up no more than 25 percent of your revenue, another 25 percent should go toward payroll, and 35 percent should go toward the product. The remaining 15 percent is what you take home. There’s an even more elegant version of that rule: Make your rent in four days to be profitable, a week to break even. If you haven’t hit the latter mark in a month, close.
When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?
-->

> *'A startup isn’t really a company at all. A startup is a set of founders with hopefully a set of proprietary insights that are a result of them living in the future. Most of the great startups come from a great insight and a great insight usually occurs when someone is living in the future and they notice something that’s missing.'*

## On networking

<!--
1. Stand tall, put a smile on your face, and roll your shoulders back and down so your hands are at your sides and not in your pockets.
2. Eye contact builds trust. dont hide yourself. dont wait to start talking. a group or a double might be an easy place to start.
5. Keep it simple. Remember, to be interesting, you’ve got to be interested.

1 - «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
2 - Small and open groups. Opening line: "Hi, I'm X and I dont know anybody in this party."
3 - Go to the bar and meet people there.
4 - Help the hosters to serve food.
5 - Escaping lines: how to politely end conversations. You should go on after 10 or 15 minutes. Think about it as exploring.
	"excuse me but i must to talk with somebody that entered the room"
	"excuse me i have to make a phone call"
	human sacrifice.. intro him and leave.
	To rude people: «my mum always told me not to speak with strangers, now I k

- What's the most common question or problem you get asked about? Share the answer.
- You'll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.
- Social inadequacy AKA creepiness is based on unpredictability. Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling or if you say hi.
- Community of experts (that give you good answers).  
- Critical peers (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career).
- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
- Networking types: shark, dolphin, drowner.  
- Not what should I do next but who should you speak next?
- the best way to get value was to start giving it away? you’re giving validation
- social adeptness is balancing two seemingly opposing social strategies: competing and cooperating

### How to network?

Be useful, not important.

Listen to people, get their goals and help them. It’s not about you, it’s about the impact you have on others and the legacy that you leave.

### How to prepare an elevator pitch?

<!--
I help (or a derivative) investors (target: people is too generalist but don’t over tailor it) to build better things (skill. use intrigue and confidence)
6 or 7 words -- short and sweet and confident and interesting. Costumise it for the context to make it more relevant.
-->

> *'When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments. Most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool. That story might be «rags to riches», «rising from the ashes», «one yes after a thousand nos», «crazy till I wasn’t» or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes.' -- Jordan Harbinger*

Choose truth or your self-mythology will seduce you.

> *'Being honest may not get you a lot of friends but it’ll always get you the right ones.' -- John Lennon*

### Why most people don’t like networking?

Handling rejection is hard. Period.

We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves. Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.

> *'I don’t know if you've ever noticed this, but first impressions are often entirely wrong.' -- Lemony Snicket*

> *'Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### How to curate your network?

Hints:

- Form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give at least as much than they take.  
- Building new connections is important but it’s even more important to remember your connections that already exist. The difference between success and failure can be as simple as keeping in touch.

# 2.3 - On teams

## On leadership

<!--
- Lou Holtz has a very pithy mental model for how to evaluate leadership: 1. Can I trust you? 2. Do you care about me? 3. Are you committed to excellence? (aka do you have high standards).
- to see who rules you, is the person you are not allowed to criticise.
- succeful takers are the most visible people in organizations.
- convincing vs inspiring leadership
- There are three keys: honesty, effectiveness, and efficiency.
-->

> *'If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.'*

Leaders are team makers. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

Being a leader is different from being a boss: it requires to be a manager and a psychotherapist. Leadership is based on emotional intelligence, people don’t follow robots, they follow the strongest person. The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Leadership is the ability to locate yourself. 

- Leaders cannot delegate culture creation, they can delegate culture keeping.
- Leaders are embassadors of their teams.
- Proactive Problem Management – Go directly to the source.

> *'A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves.' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like one.' -- Robert Greene (34th law of power)*

> *'The only thing that gives orders is balls.' -- Tony Montana*

Good leaders are leaders that grew up in the hierarchy.  

People seek leadership because they want autonomy and influence. Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.

## On management and delegation

<!--
- elephant list: Productivity happens at two levels: the individual and the collective. I’ve talked a lot about what I do on a personal level to be productive, but my other fascination is with collective productivity. As companies grow and age, they accumulate organizational debt.Organizational debt is the accumulation of decisions that should have been made but weren’t. Decisions are hard to make– a simple decision might mean one team gains while another loses. Sign-offs by multiple teams may be necessary. As a company grows and ages, it becomes even more difficult to make decisions and take meaningful action.The problem is, neglecting to make a decision causes its own set of problems. Without a decision, there’s no movement. Things stay the same. People stop talking about potential opportunities because they don’t feel they can make a change or impact. People within the organization start assuming that they're stuck with artificial constraints.In order to combat this lack of decision-making, I’ve taken to calling out the “elephants in the room” -- those things that everyone sees but no one wants to address. Identifying and calling out elephants is one of my favorite things to do because once they’re out in the open, we can develop strategies to eliminate them.What’s the biggest item to make a decision on that we’re potentially avoiding or we need leadership’s input on? One of my jobs as a manager is to do things only I can do. This is a way to make the most use of my time. A huge part of my job is calling out these elephants.Every product, every team, and every company has elephants. Every startup founder I work with as an advisor and investor carries around elephants, as well. I love sussing out what those elephants are and pushing them into the spotlight so everyone else can see it. In a large company, you often need to persuade people to take action. For example, I often need to convince my colleagues that addressing an elephant is a top priority.If everyone else is being reactive to what comes to them as opposed to being proactive in what matters most to them, then you stand to make an impact if you hold time for thinking.I conduct audits of my time.
- Try to replace the above phrases with "one option is to..." and change your thinking to complete the thought in a way that makes sense. Avoid picking favorite solutions and presenting them as the clear winner or only option. It'll get you thinking in terms of pros and cons and how to persuade other people by appealing to their point of view. It will make you appear more level-headed and capable of making decisions that are good for the business. It'll also remind you of (and force you to fully consider) the frequently hidden option that’s often forgotten when presenting a new idea or direction, which is the status quo.
- I’m a strategist, not a politician. My job sometimes is to say the thing they don’t want to hear.
- reward system. culture is influenced by structure. give to the right person
- as estruturas funcionam qd ha coesao
- Ideas are welcomed, execution is worshiped

> *'Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.' -- African proverb*

Managing is delegating. Your speed as a manager is the speed of your team.

Be productive, not cheap. Stop dicking around trying to figure stuff out that someone else already knows. Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it’s more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive». The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

A manager should make himself two questions a day:

- What is important to accomplish?  
- Where was I uncomfortable the day before?  

The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team. Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive. The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of being busy pretending you're occupied, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be. 

A great manager is a great facilitator. His responsability is to make his team better. A servant leadership.

### On teams

<!--
- metrics matter. if you choose the wrong metric you will optimize for teh wrong thing. vanity metrics are dangerous.
-->

> *'There are two ways of spreading light: to be the candle or the mirror that reflects it.' -- Edith Wharton*

People should feel as part of a tribe.

- Like animals, humans also seem designed to work in groups of a particular size. The ultimate group: Amazon’s «two-pizza teams». 
- Always be clear and specific about what you expect from other people. You cannot expect from them what you haven’t articulated, usually many times and in writing. Also plan for them to fail you.
- A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
- Know how to create a vision of where they want to go. 'I’m not here to help; I’m here to learn.'

> *'I divide my officers into four groups. There are clever, stupid, diligent and lazy officers. Usually two characteristics are combined. Some are clever and diligent -- their place is the General Staff. The next lot are stupid and lazy -- they make up 90 percent of every army and are suited to routine duties. Anyone who is both clever and lazy is qualified for the highest leadership duties, because he possesses the intellectual clarity and the composure necessary for difficult decisions. One must beware of anyone who is stupid and diligent -- he must not be entrusted with any responsibility because he will always cause only mischief.' -- Kurt von Hammerstein-Equord (General)*

### How to give feedback?

<!--
> *'The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you.' -- Markus Zusak*
- simple feedback mechanism: Continue, or consider. You get feedback that says either “Continue doing X” or “Consider changing X to make it better.” It’s really simple, fast and actionable.
-->

> *'The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent».' -- exelius_HN*

Ask instead of telling.

If the delivered work is not good enough give a reason. Spend one hour a day [communicating](#on-communication) to your people and everything will be OK. 

- «Interesting, how do you feel about it? And your team?»
- «Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.
- «Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.
- «Is that the best you can do?»

> *'Praise by name, criticize by category.' -- Warren Buffet*

> *'To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.' -- Kevin Kelly*

However gaining an understanding and giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators. Data shows people want more feedback but monthly, not daily.

### On meetings

Default to “no” for all meetings. If you can’t say no, schedule for the afternoon.

- Start with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 12%?».  
- Do not share your opinion before asking for input from your team. Lower ranked people should speak first.  
- Jeff Bezos famously banned PowerPoints in favor of «narratives» — four-to-six page memos that Amazon employees read and discuss together in meetings. He also reminded the team to leave in all internal key meetings one seat free - for their customer.

## On hiring and being hired

<!--
- growing companies are always hiring.
> *'Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to.' -- Kevin Kelly*
- The most important lessons I learned were to remember that I'd hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I'd not have had to hire them.
- (kk) Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.
- (kk) Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
- (kk) If you desperately need a job, you are just another problem for a boss; if you can solve many of the problems the boss has right now, you are hired. To be hired, think like your boss.
- I'm on a mix of hourly and value based, will try to change from 50/50 to 10/90 in favor of value based next year.
- people want freedom to choose their process.
- Hire people you can trust. You have to trust them to be adults. Give them clear goals and then get the hell out of the way so that they can do their job.
Give them the tools they ask for, not the tools a vendor suggested. They have a reason they asked for a proprietary compiler, get it for them.
Respect goes a long way and begins in the recruitment phase. It surely doesn’t end there. To get respect, you have to give respect.
At the same time, wages aren’t everything. Everyone wants to make good money but when you’re already assured of making good money, other things start to count. Help your employees in their goals. If you have a QA that wants to move to dev, don’t offer to pay back their educational expenses, but pay their expenses outright, pay for their child care, pay for their books, and keep paying their salary while they work a reduced schedule. Really, if you’re treating them right, they won’t just up and go to a new company after you've trained them.
- Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas. In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction". Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.
- If you’re a knowledge worker decisions are your product. Milton Friedman, the economist, wrote: “The best measure of quality thinking is your ability to accurately predict the consequences of your ideas and subsequent actions.”
- There’s nothing wrong in specialization -- it’s how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don’t have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.
- Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists.
- companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist.
- Try consulting or entrepreneurship. When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need. When you sell your ability to deliver results, nobody asks about your skillset.
- money is trust. system of mutual trust.
-->

> *'He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist.' -- St. Francis of Assisi*

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».

Your goal should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are. Leaders must become masters at finding and hiring talent.

- Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.

> *'Bad professionals make money off their customers, good professionals make money for their customers.' -- Jacques Mattheij*

> *'We value “T-shaped” people. That is, people who are both generalists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values.' -- Valve employee book*

### How to attract and keep talented people?

Respect them.

You'll never respect them if you don’t reward them accordingly. Use «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process. Usually people leave managers, not companies.

Good employeees are not easy to find. It takes some real chutzpah to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.

> *'Always look for internal spies, people in the enemy camp who are dissatisfied and have an ax to grind.'*

### On job applications

When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant. Hints:

- Your resume should tell the reader what is going to make you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience.
DON’T tell about your responsibilities. Everyone who is doing your type of job has those responsibilities. Tell HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person. ie. Your a car salesperson. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.  
- There are two skill levels: still learning or confident in the skill.
- Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you.
- Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.

### On asking for a raise

Don’t get discouraged if you get a «no». Simply thank them for their time and ask «What specific outcomes would be required to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?» If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

## On career

<!--
- volunteer for assignments / becoming the go to guy for some questions
- trabalhar de porta aberta vs trabalhar à porta fechada
- Oh, this is an easy one. When people say a child is talented they mean he or she is a good learner. But a talented adult is a good do-er. High potential people who fail to make an impact are stuck in child-mode, because that is what they were always praised for.
- work smart not harder but hard still. its good to be better, but is better to be different.
- Working hard for something we don’t care about is called stress; working hard for something we love is called passion.
- trade-able skills: skills you already have that you can charge for. find your unique secret sauce and NAME it. you need to get people attention
- Always Focus on Delivering More Value than Expected
- In my opinion, a job search is BOTH a numbers game and a quality game. You can control how many jobs you apply to, and how good your skills and portfolio are.
- you are a learning machine. Not an occupation.
- recruiting better than hiring: find a place where you can do a good job
- My passionate interests have changed 30 times since I graduated college.
- You don’t give a damn about that job. It’s someone else’s dream. specialized jobs are boring. I seem to get satisfaction only from making stuff. Or maybe a better description would be solving problems and making improvements.
- read the classics: deliberately being 3 years behind on the latest technologies is a really good way to stay employable without driving yourself mad keeping up with the latest and greatest..

100% time -> 100% results  
20% time -> 80%results  
So: 100% on one thing = 80% on 5 things!

### Is it better to be a specialist or a generalist?

- To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.  
- To be employed, if you pick the right specialization, you'll do better as a specialist.

### How to advance career?

Knowledge + metaknowledge (instead of asking, journal higher hierarchy than you)

- Become the best at one specific thing.  
- Become very good (top 25%) at two or more things.

### How to «pivot» career?

> *'Jobs are like clothes. There is no "wrong job". There are jobs which fit now.'*

You will either pivot or get pivoted.

You make yourself rare by combining two or more relevant “pretty goods”. Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable.

- use your transportable soft (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody’s opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills (write a pitch, can you change somebody else opinion, make a 2 minute youtube, etc) 
- stuff that looks fun for you and looks like work for others.
- take risks to boost your immune system.  

### How to know your strenghts?
 
Ask employers why did they asked you for an interview - they will describe your strengths.

## On hierarchy

Everything is hierarchy. Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

Social cartography: who’s the decision maker, to whom people are speaking and who is speaking. The highest form of the art of power is the ability to distinguish the wolves from the lambs, the foxes from hares, the hawks from vultures.
