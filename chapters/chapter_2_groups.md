# 2.1 - On cooperation

## On communication

<!--
+ naval@x -- The art of conversation is best practiced between three to four people.
-->

> *"Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens."  
-- Jimi Hendrix [1942]*

Speak less and listen more. Talk slow. Be clear. Never mumble. Don’t interrupt. If you can’t be kind, be quiet. The quieter you become. The more you can hear.

> *"A silent man is the best one to listen to." (...)  
"Say a little and say it well." (...)  
"Silence cannot be misquoted."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Give me the gift of a listening heart."  
-- King Solomon [-970]*

> *"A fool is known by his speech, and a wise man by silence."  
-- Pythagoras [-570]*

> *"Know how to listen and you will profit even from those who talk badly."  
-- Plutarch [0046]*

> *"The best way to become boring is to say everything."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"Don’t talk unless you can improve the silence."  
-- Jorge Luis Borges [1899]*

> *"People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk [1963]*

> *"The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said."  
-- Peter Drucker [1909]*

### How to communicate? 

> *"If you want to be interesting, be interested."  
-- David Ogilvy [1911]*

Be interested to be interesting. Don’t debate at all. Just listen. The point of a conversation is not to win. You don’t need to have an opinion about everything. Get fewer opinions about way fewer things and then interrogate your stronger opinions.

Hints:

- Listen. Mirroring or paraphrase: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question or repeat what they just said in your own words. (Yes, it’s that simple). Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Don’t worry about what you’re going to say next. Speak what’s in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Be interested to be interesting. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..
- Ask questions. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. No one is boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions. But you must be curious, asking questions without paying attention is worthless. Making good/unusual questions will make people interested in you. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It’s hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but cF\rucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments or asking for advice.
- Stop trying to impress. Focus on being interested instead of being interesting. Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and it will appear as fake. Smile and relax. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people always smile more. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Don’t be stubborn. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don’t judge. Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.
- Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day.
- People believe in everything, if you whisper it.

> *"The more you say, the less people remember."  
-- François Fénelon [1651]*

> *"Think like a wise man but communicate in the language of the people."  
-- W.B. Yeats [1865]*

> *"A little inaccuracy sometimes saves tons of explanation."  
-- H.H. Munro [1870]*

> *"Two monologues do not make a dialogue."  
-- Mikhail Bakhtin [1895]*

> *"Everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are married or own a house; as if life was some kind of grocery list. But nobody ever asks if you are happy."  
-- Heath Ledger [1979]*

### How to discord?

<!--
> *"A bore is someone who persists in holding his own views after we have enlightened him with ours."*

- A loucura é a incapacidade de comunicar-se.
-->

> *"Admit when you’re wrong. Shut up when you’re right."  
-- John Gottman [1942]*

Don’t raise your voice. improve your argument.

Listen as you’re wrong. Ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. If they can explain why they are correct, you’ll learn something. If they can’t you’ll soften their views. The more we disagree, the more chance there is that at least one of us is right.

> *"Be curious, not judgmental."  
-- Walt Witman [1819]*

> *"Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference." (...)  
"Never argue with stupid people, because they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Tact is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"With truly logical people, most arguments are very short and based mainly on differing assumptions."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to tell stories?

> *"Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out."  
-- Alfred Hitchcock [1899]*

Good stories condense a massive amount of details into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment.

> *"To tell a good story, you must reveal a surprise; otherwise is just a report."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On public speaking

<!--
- study your audience reaction more than yourself.
-->

> *"Eloquence is logic on fire."  
-- Lyman Beecher [1775]*

Hints:

- You don’t need to answer their questions. You can say whatever you want if it’s interesting but learn when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions.
- Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of desagreeing.

> *"If you want to reach a large audience, appeal to idiots."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer [1788]*

> *"A good speech should be like a woman’s skirt: long enough to cover the subject and short enought o create interest."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"Improvisation is the ability to talk with oneself."  
-- Cecil Taylor [1929]*

> *"Always say less than necessary."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






---
## On networking

> *"The enemy of excellence is isolation."  
-- Aaron Walker [1910]*

Make networking an habit. Who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

> *It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone."  
-- John Maynard Keynes [1883]*

> *"Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right."  
-- Charles Bukowski [1920]*

> *"To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"Money is the ultimate network effect." (...)  
"Nothing will attract people to you as much as your values."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to network?

> *"Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead." (...)  
"When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Be useful, not important. Listen to people, get their goals and help them. It’s not about you, it’s about the impact you have on others.

<!--
- Community of experts (that give you good answers). Critical peers (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career).
- everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying, «Make me feel important». Never forget this message when working with people.
- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
- Networking types: shark, dolphin, drowner.
- Not what should I do next but who should you speak next?
- What’s the most common question or problem you get asked about? Share the answer.
- Avoid forcing connections.
- Do not beg. Do not call twice. Do not explain yourself. Do not simp. Respect yourself. Do not insult yourself: If they reject you, they are not worthy of your presence.
- shyness costs a fortune
- The first time you meet people, treat them as well as you possibly can – after that, treat them as they treat you.
- When you first meet someone, introduce yourself as a nobody, watch how they treat you, you will gauge their true character, you will understand how they treat others.
- You don’t meet people by accident. There’s always a reason. A lesson or a blessing.
-->

Hints:

- Social adeptness is balancing two seemingly opposing social strategies: competing and cooperating.
- Building new connections is important but it’s even more important to remember the connections that already exist.
- Form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give as much than they take. The best way to get value was to start giving it away even by giving validation.
- You’ll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.
- Social inadequacy (creepiness) is based on unpredictability. Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling or if you say hi.
- Field tactics:
	- «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
	- Eye contact builds trust. Don’t hide yourself. Don’t wait to start talking. A group or a double might be an easy place to start.
	- Small and open groups. Opening line: "Hi, I’m X and I dont know anybody in this party."  
	- Go to the bar and meet people there or help the hosters to serve food.
	- You should go on after 10 or 15 minutes, think about it as exploring. How to politely end conversations:
		- «Excuse me but I must to talk with somebody that entered the room.»
		- «Excuse me I have to make a phone call.»
		- Human sacrifice... Introduce him and leave.
		- To rude people: «My mum always told me not to speak with strangers.»
- Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.

> *"I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"You can make more friends in two months by becoming interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you."  
-- Dale Carnegie [1888]*

> *"If you expect magic in every encounter, you’ll find it."  
-- Adam Robinson [1955]*

> *"Millenials who learn the dark Boomer arts of phone calls and eye contact will inherit the earth."  
-- molson_hart@x*

### Why most people don’t like networking?

Handling rejection is hard. Period. We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves.

> *"Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

-->

> *"Being honest may not get you a lot of friends but it’ll always get you the right ones."  
-- John Lennon [1940]*

Choose truth or your self-mythology will seduce you.

> *"When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments. Most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool. That story might be «rags to riches», «rising from the ashes», «one yes after a thousand nos», «crazy till I wasn’t» or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes."  
-- Jordan Harbinger [1980]*

> *"when you want to tell stories, be it startup pitches, or just stories about your experiences, always share them in three points—no more, no less. the human mind & the underlying world gravitates towards threes, look at any industry, typically the equilibrium points lie in threes. there are also numerous other examples that paint this phenomena. it’s a magic number for communication. story tellers rule the world."

They’re not immortal, and they’re not going to be—most likely, not at this time scale. So you have more youth than them. You have a lot of advantages over them. The wealth gaps are actually much smaller than people think. A lot of that is due to mass production, which comes from specialization, labor, and capitalism. But it’s very easy to overlook that and agitate—because that gets you higher in the status hierarchy with other monkeys. It makes you look like you’re fighting for noble causes and gives you status, which is really what people are craving these days. They’re craving status, not money or wealth. And status is a zero-sum game. So it’s kind of an evil game to play because there have to be losers for every winner. And the only way to win is by crushing somebody else down."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

So the future of consumer products depends on how well you can detect, define, and create what people want before they know it. Traditional market research might be less useful because most people don’t know/can’t articulate what they want—it’s up to the artistically intuitive and psychologically inclined thinkers to find the local religion or patterns of belief and desire in a given market. “Everywhere I go I find a poet has been there before me.” (Freud)

> *"I think the role of the entrepreneur in the world is to find ways to do things better or more efficiently and then try to do that as many times over with the help of other people."  
-- Santiago Nestares [1997]*

Focus on what you can easily give that empowers others.

Validate your business by finding paying clients. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. The more they pay, the more they value it - the consumer votes with his wallet. It’s not about what you know, it’s about who trusts you to solve their problems. Often, it requires the technical skills. Always, it requires the persuasion skills.

First try to sell it. Than build it.

If you build something that people say they’ll pay for and then they don’t then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn’t make you a «wannapreneur». At that point it’s just part of the struggle.

Hints:

- If you have an idea, test it and launch now. It’s called putting out a “minimally viable product” or MVP. Timing is the most important factor in startup success (quick to start but not the first). Team and execution came next. Find the 80/20 solution. Don’t put a bunch of effort to find out there’s no paying demand. 
- The bottleneck for success often is not knowledge of the tools, but lack of understanding of the customer needs. It’s easier when YOU are the customer. Start with something you’re interested in. Don’t worry about the theory, focus on solving the problem.
- Do the math. When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?
- In some complex and mature markets if you start small you my never be able to compete with existent players.
- Create a culture that rewards killing ideas. Nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something, we saved a lot of money.
- Do things manually at first. Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want. Only after you are over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. 
- Focus on revenue generating activities: if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it or outsource them so you have more time to work on your cash flow.
- Deliver a little bit more than expected. That’ll help to get you some recommendations.
- «Fire» nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients.
- Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population. Budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.
- There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is true only if you study your failures.

If you try something easy, there will be five other companies doing the same thing two months later. But if you try something that’s difficult at first, everything gets much easier as soon as you make it through those initial challenges.

And when you have better people and less competition, raising capital gets easier, too."

+ @MoZarrinsadaf -- Marketing is attention engineering.

- 0 visibility x 100 skills = 0 opportunities
- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like: What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.
- always negotiate. dont communicate weakness on your negotiation. your first reaction should be no reaction. fight impulse to imediatelly give the answer.
- If you run enough A/B tests online, you’ll end up with a porn site.
- make clear agreements and hell yes agreements, keeping my agreements (90%), renegotiating agreements before they break, clean my agreements after breaking them.
- marketing position makes sense when there is confusion who your client is. know where you fit and what can you offer better the next guy. help your client to make a decision. let them understand if your product is teh right for them.
- my prices are based on my talent, not your budget.
- Raise your prices, lower your stress.
- Responding to Job Offers for Maximum Impact- Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.) Never make the first offer. Thank them. Set the tone for the negotiation. Display social proof/market validation. Set your “ask.” Help them visualize the win. Reiterate interest and close strong.
- sell the problem you solve, not the product you have.
- There is no such thing as "shortage" of anything. Just pay more, and you’ll get it.

Letter One [Strong Response]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]
I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]
I look forward to your response. [Power close.]
Cheers,
Alex “Dream Employee” Kouts

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]
Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]
I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

- First establish a baseline — use Google. Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?” “Will you do that -10%?” “If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?” “If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?” “What if I pay cash?” “Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.” WALK AWAY.
- Unexpressed feelings never die. Releasing pressure is different from venting.
- The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.
- Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.
- Cold call all owners to rent. 8 said yes. Then auction! 
- irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don’t want to do. agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do. agitate more than irritate.

- how to say no to an interview: i think i said already everthing about that subject.
- how to say no to something else: i think i did already what i can do.
- how much would i have to pay to close this deal now
- smart partners negotiate fair deals because they know that lopsided deals are fragile and that most value accumulates in long term trust relationships. you can tell a lot about a potential partner by their opening offer. (naval)

We’re all in sales. To sell is to deal with objections.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it’s mostly applied persuasion and keeping relationships. Best sellers are now ambiverts. Being recomendend is the best marketing.

Traditional selling: hunters (extroverts)

- Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
- Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
- Persisting (to push until you make the sale)  

Modern selling: farmers (ambiverts and introverts)

- Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the web, reading and analyzing information)  
- Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
- Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

### On negotiation
	
<!--
> *"He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation."*

- You are not paid what you are worth. You are paid what you negotiate for.
-->

> *"Negotiations are won by whoever cares less."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

You don’t get what you deserve in life, only what you negotiate.

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value). That said, a good negotiation means that you are giving less money (or value) than receiving value (or money).

Hints:

- You can only negotiate with integrous people.
- To negotiate you need to have options.
- To go fast, let the other part go first.
- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating. The analytical cold guy is very patient. The assertive guy wants to make it fast. For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important.
- Be playful and smart. Your counter-part will often mirror your good mood.
- Mirroring by repeating the last few words of the other person. It opens up people’s brain. It tests the firmness of what they want.
- Show arbitrage: If they pay X, now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the only way to sell.
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.
- Never negotiate with binary questions: prefer «What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»
- Close it: «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. When people feel they have a choice, they «walk into your trap» that much more easily.
- People buy better versions of themselves, not products.
- Females buy male products. Males don’t buy products targetted to females.
- Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.
- Marketing is a symptom of excess production.

-- David Mamet [1947]*

> *"When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

However always strive to achieve a win-win situation. When both sides don’t take what they need from it, the deal may fall. The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.

-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show. I said, «$1500». She said, «Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?» I said, «$2000». She said, «No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!» I said, «Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.» She liked that so much she came up with the $1500."  
-- Derek Sivers [1969]*

-- Henry David Thoreau [1817]*

> *"Price is what you pay, value is what you get."

> *"No one has ever become poor by giving."  
-- Anne Frank [1929]*

> *"A bit of fragrance clings to the hand that gives flowers." (...)  
"A candle loses nothing by lighting another candle."  
-- vox populi*

No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.

Hints:

- If you can afford the dinner you can afford the tip.
- Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.
- A low value gift may have the opposite effect.

> *"A guest and a fish stink in three days."

> *"The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have."  
-- Leonard Nimoy [1931]*

> *"The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he’d learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I’ll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn’t be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people’s talents. He’d hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn’t want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there." (...)  
"My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn’t lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human."  
-- danielvf@hn*

### On incentives

> *"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, there are consequences."  
-- Robert G. Ingersoll [1833]*

Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.

Hints:

- We learn complex behaviors via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. After the behaviour is learnt, continuous reinforcement becomes intermitent reinforcement.
- Instead of punishments extingue rewards.
- The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your presence and attention.
- Punish bad behavior consistently, reward good behavior intermittently

> *"Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education."  
-- Zhuang Zhou [-369]*

- a leader makes the people next to them better version of themselves.
- A man asked a gardener why his plants grew so beautifully. The gardener said: «I don’t force them to grow. I remove what stops them.»
- convincing vs inspiring leadership
- Lou Holtz has a very pithy mental model for how to evaluate leadership: 1. Can I trust you? 2. Do you care about me? 3. Are you committed to excellence?
- never make a numbers person the leader
- Proactive problem management – Go directly to the source.
- succeful takers are the most visible people in organizations.
- the organization is always modelling the leader. military leader don’t have money to distribute. is way easier. monetary bonus are more a requirement than a motivator now and is negative because people may think they getting unfairly treated.
- There are three keys: honesty, effectiveness, and efficiency.

> *"An army of sheep led by a lion is better than an army of lions led by a sheep."  
-- Alexander the great [-357]*

> *"Raise your words, not your voice. It is rain that grows flowers not thunders."  
-- Rumi [1207]*

Leaders are team makers. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

Being a leader is different from being a boss: it requires to be a manager and a psychotherapist. Leadership is based on emotional intelligence, people don’t follow robots, they follow the strongest person. The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Leadership is the ability to locate yourself. 

Hints:

- Leaders are embassadors of their teams. They can delegate culture keeping but not culture creation. 
- If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.
- Best leaders are leaders that grew up in the hierarchy.
- People seek leadership because they want autonomy and influence. Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.

## On management and delegation

<!--

Managing is delegating. A great manager is a great facilitator. His responsability is to make his team better. 

Hints:

- A manager should answer two questions a day: «What is important to accomplish?» and «Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.
- Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive. The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of being busy pretending you’re occupied, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be. 
- Spend one hour a day communicating to your people and everything will be OK.
- Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it’s more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive». The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

People should feel as part of a tribe. While the tribe is cohese, external threats will pass.

Hints:

- A chain is only as strong as its weakest link.
- Like animals, humans also seem designed to work in groups of a particular size. The ultimate group: Amazon’s «two-pizza teams».

### How to give feedback?

<!--
TEN TIPS ON GIVING FEEDBACK
- Give at least five times more positive feedback than negative.
- Give feedback soon after the behavior you want to respond to.
- Pick the moment when both of you are in the right frame of mind.
- Keep it private. Feedback is not a spectator sport.
- Prepare. Take the time to organize what you want to say.
- Avoid generalities. Cite specific examples.
- Focus on the issue or behavior, not the person.
- Pay attention to body language. Adjust your feedback accordingly.
- Keep it simple. Don’t focus on too many things at once.
- End on a positive note.
-->

> *"The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent»."  
-- exelius@hn*

Ask instead of telling.

Continue, or consider. You give feedback that says either «continue doing X» or «consider changing X to make it better». If the delivered work is not good enough give a reason. It’s really simple, fast and actionable.

Hints:

- «Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.
- «Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.
- «Interesting, how do you feel about it? And your team? Is that the best you can do?»

> *"Good advice is something a man gives when he is too old to set a bad example."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld [1613]*

> *"Praise by name, criticize by category."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and once more. The third time’s answer is close to the truth." (...)  
"Work on your tone. Often ideas are rejected because of the tone of voice they are wrapped in. Humility covers many blemishes." (...)  
"If you are impressed with someone’s work, you should tell them, but even better, tell their boss."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Ask for feedback on your attempts, not advice on your ideas."  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

Giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators. Howewer, don’t do it daily.

### On meetings

Default to «no» for all meetings. Meetings are the death of productivity.

If you can’t say no, schedule for the afternoon and preferably as walking meetings (exercise and sunlight; less pleasantries; more dialogue, less monologue; no slides; end easily by walking back).

Hints:

- Start with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 20%?».
- Do not share your opinion before asking for input from your team. Lower ranked people should speak first.
- Tell the bad news promptly. Good news can wait. (Berkshire policy)
- People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.
- Instead of PowerPoints use «narratives» — four-to-six page memos that employees read and discuss together. (Jeff Bezos)
- Leave one seat free - for your customer. (Jeff Bezos)
- Text me when you’re ready for the call but then give me 15 minutes.

## On mentorship

<!--
+ dears_o_n@x -- You’re a man. Never argue with your father. Shut up or walk away.

- Teach principles, not formulas. Understand, don’t memorize.
- What do I do that is most annoying to you? Say thank you and don’t discuss it. Don’t act on it. JRtruust put it in your mind.
-->

> *"To know the road ahead, ask those coming back."  
-- vox populi*

Feedback from mentors speeds up improvement. Even if you can’t understand the logic behind their wisdom, they’ll show you the door. Don’t take criticism from people that you would never go for advice.

Be generous and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

> *"He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever." (...)  
"I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot."

### How to find mentors?

> *"When the student is ready the teacher appears. When the student is truly ready the teacher disapeers."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

A paid mentor isn’t a mentor. It’s a salesperson.

Look for the «silver medalist». He has more availability, and sometimes, a better attitude than «the golden child».

### How to mentor your kids?

<!--
+ @naval -- "Children are happy because: 1) They're not self conscious 2) They lack a sense of time pressure 3) They've no goals. The bottom line is they are living from moment to moment, and the mind is not there to interfere in their bliss."

- Absent parent: troubled child
- A father is the one who reveals the truth about life to the kids. A mother is the one who comforts them after hearing it.
- children don’t need a perfect teacher. they need a happy teacher, who’s gonna make them excited to come to school and grow a love for learning.
- Children learn to be kind by experiencing kindness. Not by being told to be kind.
- your child’s behaviour triggers you because deep down inside lives a child that was shamed for behaving the same way.
-->

> *"Teach your children early what you learned late." (...)  
"Teach your children how to think, not what to think."  
-- Richard Feynman [1918]*

> *"If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"The only thing worse than a boy who hates you: a boy that loves you."  
-- Markus Zusak [1975]*

Your father is your first mentor.

Don’t tell your kids how to live. Live fully and let them see. Spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

Prepare the child for the path, not the child for the path.

<!--
> *"My partner teacher does this lovely thing when a student in his class gives him an «I don’t know» response. He simply says, «tell me something you do know that might be helpful»."
> *"Presence rids us of the need for parenting «strategies», many of which are more manipulative than nurturing."  -- Julie Louisson *

- we become good parents when you start to control yourself instead of controlling your child.
- If you don’t have kids you’ll be the first organism of your direct ancestors to not reproduce since the beggining of life. 
- we are raising weak men and girls who need validation because their father wasn’t there.
- teenagers = treated like children but expected to act like adults
- the letter i wrote my kids after they born: you might think you want an expensive car, fancy watch and a huge car. but i’m telling you, you don’t. what you want is respect and admiration from other people and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. it almost nver does especially from the people you want it.
- ask coolest moment of their week or favorite food.
- monthly photo of your kid room and yearly lenghty video of your kid speaking
> *"Children are natural mimics who act like their parents despite every effort to teach them good manners. Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually *repeat word for word what you shouldn’t have said.*
-->

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar. Parents prevent their kid from dying but as they get older they shouldn’t prevent them from living.

> *"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you’re unstoppable."

Become the best at one specific thing or very good at two or more things.

Hints:

- You don’t get anywhere, and for more money, sitting in the same seat.
- Happy, smart, and useful. Work smart not harder but hard still. It’s good to be better, but is better to be different.
- Metaknowledge (instead of asking, journal higher hierarchy than you).
- Deliver more value than expected.

- use your transportable soft (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody’s opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills (write a pitch, can you change somebody else opinion, make a 2 minute youtube, etc)

### Employee or entrepreneur?

Employees have no control over their futures. The economy forces all the risk on them.

Hints:

- When you sell your ability to deliver results nobody asks about your skillset. When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need.
- Rich people get paid by project and pay by the hour.
- The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn’t want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn’t get for it, is a failure in his eyes.

-- realestatetrent@x*

### Specialist or generalist?

<!--
- There’s nothing wrong in specialization - it’s how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don’t have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.
-->

Hints:

- To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.
- To be employed, if you pick the right specialization, you’ll do better as a specialist.
- Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists.

### How to know your strenghts?

Ask employers why did they asked you for an interview - they will describe your strengths.

## On hiring and being hired

<!--
> *"Hire character. Train skill."  -- Peter Schutz*
> *"Tell me the story of your life. problems and how you solved them."  -- Elon Musk [1971]*

- Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas. In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction". Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.
- hiring questions: sucess history. why did you go that company and why did you left.

- Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.
- Your boss doesn’t care how hard you work. They care how easy you make their job.

> *"He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist."  
-- St. Francis of Assisi [1181]*

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».

Your goal should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are. Leaders must become masters at finding and hiring talent.

Hints:

- When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant. Don’t do interviews, do discussions.
- Employers are just trying to find somebody they like, that’s what «culture fit» is. Often is not how good you are, you just have to be liked while being sufficiently good. Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you. And people like people like themselves.
- Good interview questions:
	- «Problems you’ve solved and how did you solve them?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What did you get done this week?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What do you own and why?» (Sandy Gottesman, investor)
	- «What do you believe that most people don’t?»
	- «Show me your calendar». A lot of detailed stuff is an implementer. (Codie Sanchez)
	- «How to solve this X problem I have right now?» To detect a fast thinker. (Codie Sanchez)
- Remember that I’d hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I’d not have had to hire them. Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
- Companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist. Growing companies are always hiring.
- Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.
- A job search is both a numbers game and a quality game. You can control how many jobs you apply to, and how good your skills and portfolio are.

### On resumes

> *"Your real resume is a painful recounting of all your struggles."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Hints:

- Your resume should tell the reader why you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience. Tell HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person. ie. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.
- There are two skill levels: still learning or confident.

> *"Whatever makes you weird is probably your greatest asset."  
-- Joss Whedon [1964]*

### How to attract and keep talented people?

Respect them. You’ll never respect them if you don’t reward them accordingly.

Hints:

- Use «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process. Usually people leave managers, not companies.
- Smart people will not work extremely hard just for money.
- Good employees are not easy to find. It takes some real *chutzpah* to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.
- Asking for a raise. Don’t get discouraged if you get a «no». Simply thank them for their time and ask «What specific outcomes would be required to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?» If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

# 2.2 - On competition

## On hierarchy

<!--
> *"If you can smile when things go wrong, you have someone in mind to blame.*
> *"No hay prepotencia más ridícula que la que se destila de la creencia de que recopilar talento ajeno es un talento."  -- Jorge Luis Borges [1899]*
> *"technology: belief in competence. Regulation: belief in influence"  -- rapahelz@x*

- be careful what you tolerate. You are teaching people how to treat you
- Call a rich guy poor, and all he will do is smirk. Call a powerful man weak, and all he will do is smirk. Call a charming misogynist a «virgin», and all he will do is smirk. If it affects you, it is true.
- civilized war: please the master and positive relationship with servants. if you appear too ambitious they’ll bring you down.
- How he carries himself is how he will be treated. A man with supreme confidence and self-assurance will be treated like one.
- if you don’t like something, just take away its only power: your attention.
- in any hierarchy there are zealots
- No one cares about you until you win. No one is ever ignoring you, everyone is focused on their goals, and you should be doing the same.
- People don’t fly business class just for the seat. They do it to not have to spend 12 hours with normies. The more money you make the more you realize the barriers to luxury are not just for comfort. But for seperation.
- People like to feel in control. if we try them to get them do something, people feel disempowered. if they feel that somebody is deciding for them they say no when they would be happy to go along.
- people respect who they can’t disrespect. 
- Stop wasting time on fake achievements. Learn to fight, build, or make money. Real men create, not escape.
- Weak managers believe if an employee becomes irreplaceable, they have become expendable. Keeping employees dispensable is more important than keeping skilled talent. Their actions aren’t random or stupid.

Everything is hierarchy. Only comedians can speak the truth without consequences.

However don’t vow to the gatekeepers. Someone’s position does not make them important. You can replace them as quickly as they can replace you. It’s a business relationship.

<!--
> *"If you don’t like a person, it’s because they remind you of something you don’t like about yourself."  -- Sigmund Freud [1856]*
> *"Só os mais corajosos conseguem fazer a paz."  -- Trump*

- Be willing to side with the minority.
- Find cassandras to stop catastrophes. The “Cassandras” are experts in their field. These people are data driven.
- i fear not the man who’s read ten thousand books, but the man who’s read the book ten thousand times.
- Nietszche says to measure one’s strength by the number of parasites one can support.
- surpass a gatekeeper: i’m x, i know your situation and how is the way i can make it the most confortable (safe) for you.
- The wicked don’t listen. When you shame a good man for a small infraction, he feels guilty. He tries to do better. When you shame a genuinely bad man, he doesn’t care. He views you with contempt because you do. Shaming the incorrigible is futile. Pointless.
- understand the difference of an adversary and an enemy to not accumulate enemys.
- When narratives begin to shift and the once good guys are labelled as bad it’s not surprising they fight back. They’ll point to criticisms as exaggerations. Their faults as misunderstandings.
- your competition isn’t other people. Your competition is your proscrastination. Your ego. The unhealthy food you’re consuming, the knowledge you neglect. The negative behaviour you’re nurturing & your lack of creativity. Compete against that.

People are amazing optimizers and will find any loopholes or gaps to their advantage. Only your parents will help you in a way that is prejudicial to them.

### On desperate opponents

> *"Necessity knows no law." (...)  
"Fear can make a donkey attack a lion."  
-- vox populi*

Beware of sad people.

Desperate players will risk everything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *"Don’t fight a starving animal. Never contend with a man who has nothing to Lose; for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict. The other enters without anxiety; having lost everything, including shame, he has no further loss to fear. He therefore re-sorts to all kinds of insolence."  
-- Balthasar Gracian [1601]*

> *"Beware the fury of a patient man."  
-- John Dryden [1631]*

### On difficult opponents

The thougest competition is a good enough competitor.

Besides outworking them, you’ll need all weaponry. Sometimes even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff». They may be effective but use them only on desperate situations: it’s a scar for life.

### On allies

<!--
- Your biggest supporters will be strangers, and your biggest critics will be people you know.
- if you find someone smarter than you, don't compete. Work together.

The human strenght is the ability to cooperate. Heros are fictional stories. Anyway your follower is not always your fan.

Hint:

- Buy from your community. Sell to outsiders.

> *"War is what happens when language fails."

Avoiding conflict will not keep peace, will rot it. Rotten peace builds resentment.

Small (but relevant) conflicts will grow into big conflicts. What could have been very small is now a real problem that may compromise your relationship.

### On conflict resolution

You’re either part of the solution or part of the problem.

Hints:

- Use «we». Mean it and take responsability.
- Bring options to the table. It’s easier to negotiate down.

> *"A quarrel is quickly settled when deserted by one party; there is no battle unless there be two."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

> *"Think before you speak. There is always time to add a word, never to withdraw one. Talk as if you were making your will: the fewer words the less litigation."

One recent tweet I had said, “The right to vote does not give you power. Power gives you the right to vote." You can just do a simple thought exercise: If there were a hundred of us on a desert island and we’re trapped, and we all kind of have to cooperate to create a new society. Suppose there are 10 people on the island who are all from the same ethnic background, who are all extremely unified, and they have all the guns. Those 10 have it, the other 90 don’t. Who do you think is going to end up running the place “for the benefit of the others"? Anyone who’s been around the block a few times knows what’s going to happen. So it’s just the nature of humans that if you want freedom at the individual level, if you want the rights to be dispersed and distributed, the power has to be dispersed and distributed.

> *"A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic."*
And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.
But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.
Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.
The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.

> *"For the friends: everything. For the others: the law."  
-- Niccoló Machiavelli (paraphrased) [1469]*

Politicians hate risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending people, specially their voters.

Hints:

- Politicians don’t get educated, they get bought.
- The opposite of corruption is patriotism. To reduce corruption diminish people involved on analogic processes.
- Taxes are a membership fee that most of us are voluntarily overpaying.
- Inequality is a problem. Equality is not the solution. That’s the dilemma.
- Changes from within are more sustainable than revolutions. We don’t need great individuals, we need institutions that work.
- Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.
- The moment you cross a second border, you are an economic migrant, not a refugee.

> *"Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

Society is run by peer pressure, not intelligence.

Most people are other people. People accept the defaults very easily. Our thoughts are someone else opinions and we jump to conclusions. Our insecurities drive us to excess and overcompensation. We are, at heart, animals and we are easily manipulated, especially in groups.

Groups of people behave differently than individuals. The larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. This effect is known as mob behaviour. This is also why individuals should make decisions. Groups never admit failure.

Stupidity is the cost of intelligence operating in a complex environment and it’s almost inevitable. Most people don’t actually think, they just take their first thought and go. There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default. That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!», it means they’ve stopped thinking.

It’s easier to recognise stupidity in others than ourselves but don’t take for granted that others are acting stupid. Common sense is not so common.

### How to judge someone?

<!--
- your perception of me is a reflection of you
-->

> *"Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

We judge ourselves by our thoughts but society judges us by what we can do for them.

Hints:

- When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability.
- Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.
- Judge people on their habits.

> *"Nearly all men can stand adversity, but if you want to test a man’s character, give him power."  
-- Abraham Lincoln [1809]*
 
> *"We should not judge people by their peak of excellence; but by the distance they have traveled from the point where they started."  
-- Henry Ward Beecher [1813]*

> *"A man is as big as the things that make him angry." (...)  
"A fanatic is a person who can’t change his mind and won’t change the subject."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"Everything that irritates us about others can lead us to an understanding of ourselves."

> *"We don’t judge people when we feel good about ourselves."  
-- Brene Brown [1965]*

> *"If a man gets lost in the mountains, hundreds will search and often two or three searchers are killed. But the next time somebody gets lost, just as many volunteers turn out.

> *"A serious and good philosophical work could be written consisting entirely of jokes."  
-- Ludwig Wittgenstein [1889]*

Comedians are the modern day philosophers. They observe the hidden life truths that everyone knows but nobody has ever quite articulated. The truer the things they say, the funnier they are. 

> *"I miss being the age when I thought I would have my shit together by the time I was the age I am now." (...)  
"Sex, like pizza, when it’s good is good. When it’s bad it gets in your shirt." (...)

- Choose people that choose you. The end.
- Loyalty is earned, not owed. If they drain your energy, stunt your growth, or disrespect your boundaries, let them go. You weren’t born to carry dead weight. Protect your peace and move forward.
- Never force, don’t beg and don’t chase.
- One day you’re going to miss how much I cared.
- The more you do for people the less gratitude they show. The more you go out of your way for them to like you, the less appreciative they are of you. too much availability kills your VALUE.

> *"Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Never allow someone to be your priority while allowing yourself to be their option."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

Focus on what you can give. However, after taking first steps, mirror their behavior. Don’t cross oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you.

Hints:

- If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.
- If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.
- Trust and vulnerability are correlated. Don’t hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.
- Supporting helps people grow and builds healthy relationships. Fixing manipulates people and builds resentment and/or co-dependency.
- Sometimes connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.

> *"Faults are thick where love is thin."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you."  
-- Dream Hampton [1971]*

> *"Play long-term games with long-term people. The secret to a happy relationship is two happy people. If you loose somebody for being yourself, then you never had them to begin with. Find a relationship where you, naturally being you, makes the other person happy and viceversa. The worst way to build a relationship is to try to build a relationship. The people you most want to impress can read your intentions."    
-- Naval Ravikant {paraphrased} [1974]*

## On family and friends

<!--
> *"Your family is broken but you’re going to fix the world."  -- naval@x*
> *"Absence, the highest form of presence."  -- James Joyce*

- I love Nietzsche’s definition of friendship, which is "people with whom you share one great suffering and one great hope." You can’t be friends unless you hate the same things and worship the same Gods
- If you look at the people in your circle and don’t get inspired, you don’t have a circle. You have a cage.
- Instead of trying to change people, curate them.
- stay way from people who act like a victim in a problem they created.
- The older you get as a man, the more you understand your father and forgive him for everything.
- The price of growth is outgrowing people.
- The real miracle of Jesus was having 12 close friends in your late 30s
- There are cycles in life. Do not expect people to level up with you. You are not supposed to keep the same friends forever.
- You need friends who inspire you to do better, not acquaintances who tell you what you can’t do.
- Your girlfriend will get a new boyfriend. Your boss will replace you before your burial. But your mum won’t get another son. Take care of her. Your birthday is for your mom, not you.
- your single female friends are the most toxic thing in your relationship DUMP them!
- Your successful friends will leave you behind if you don’t level up too.

> *"True friendship can exist only between equals."  
-- Plato [-427]*

> *"If everybody loves you, something is wrong."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

Life is meant to be lived in community but don’t settle for a place where you’re tolerated. Go where you’re celebrated.

Be independent from your family but loyal at the same time. Keep your friends for friendship but work with the skilled and competent. Resist the temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

### How to curate your friends?

You are the average of your friends.

If you’re always the smartest in the room, you’re in the wrong room. When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.

Hints:

- If your absence doesn’t bother them, your presence never mattered.
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are. People who genuinely want the best for you are very rare and they are usually already wealthy, loved and happy.
- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
- You’re never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you. Second step is inviting them to do something. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. You know someone is a friend when you can go long stretches without talking and the talk is right where we left off.
- It’s ok to unfollow people in real life. Don’t let your loneliness tempt you to reconnect with toxic people. You wouldn’t drink poison just because you’re thirsty.
- Pay attention to who you’re with when you feel your best.
- Be suspicious of people who like being owed a favor. Especially if it is not a favor you requested.
- Maintain old friendships. 
- Bad friends will prevent you from having good friends.
- You only grow apart from people who don’t grow.

> *"Brothers love each other when they are equally rich."

> *"I don’t like that man. I must get to know him better."

> *"Porn has prolonged more marriages than it’s ever destroyed."  -- Rollo Tomasi*
> *"Some advice i gave to my friend: your value as a man should never be reduced to how you look. On dating apps that’s all you are—your height, & your face.

- A man will cry for a woman once in his lifetime. After that, his soul will never allow him to ever trust women (or fully love) ever again.
- Date multiple women, and you’ll never fall in love. Date only one woman, and you’ll lose faith in love.
- I always have this fear that one day you are going to discover that i’m not as great as you once thoght I was.
- I once asked my grandpa: «Why should I not go back to my ex». He replied: «If you see the same tree in the forest twice, it’s because you are lost».

- Men will spend money on women they don’t love, but a woman will never spend money on a man she doesn’t love.

> *"We accept the love we think we deserve."  
-- Stephen Chbosky [1970]*

You attract what you are.

Love is what happens to men and women that don’t know each other. Love doesn’t hurt, expectations do. Every person feels loved in a different form.

Hints:

- We fall in love with someone because of how they make us feel about ourselves.
- We’re always looking for somebody that looks for us. First parents, then a lover. Screens give us 100% attention. Tech is a compensation.
- Man’s loyalty is tested when he has everything. Woman’s loyalty is tested when her man has nothing.
- Arguing and insecurity is anti-seductive. Familiarity is the death of seduction.
- Relationships start with «can we talk» to «we need to talk». Once you start disliking someone, everything they do is irritating to you. A dirty dish by the sink can be a big marriage problem.
- Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.

+ buridansridge@x -- Skilled male seducers understand that women’s kryptonite is a grounded, authentic, and calm masculine man. He is often disarmingly honest, but in an eloquent way. He allows for her to be who she desires to be in his presence. Seduction is about satisfying her desire to feel safe and seen. Mystery is the mistress of desire. Infer how you feel, because things don’t always need to be spelled out clearly. Women want to read between the lines. We fall in love through our minds. If we think about you because we are trying to solve you, our minds will do the work for you.

- A man without money can be loved... by his mother. Women respect security, power, and ambition. If you’re broke, you’re tolerated at best and ignored at worst.
- Every woman wants sex, she just wants it from the best.
- Girls don’t leave good guys. They leave boring ones.
- I want a man that sees my demons.
- If you’re waiting for a man to get rich before you take him serious, take note. "Men don’t fall in love when they’re rich"
- My man needs to have good social skills. I don’t care how he gets them.
- Only a coward is worse than a boring guy. I want neither of them.
- What men think women want: Looks and money. What women actually need: Leadership, humor, honesty, intelligence, resilience, certainty in their actions.
- Without money only mother can love you.
- Women want to be desired, not because it gives them connection, but because it gives them control.
- Women would break down crying if they understood how much more pure men are compared to them.

### What men value in women

<!--
- Men do not care if a woman is an engineer or a doctor. They only care about if she’s loyal, respectful and virgin.
- Men hate disrespect more than they love sex
- Men pick loyal girls over successful ones. Girls pick successful men over loyal ones.
- Young women value themselves based on how much men want to sleep with them, which gives them a false high self valuation. If they valued themselves based on how much men wanted to marry them once they got to know them, they’d have a much more accurate estimation of their worth.

Every boy wants a good girl to be bad just for him. Every girl wants a bad boy to be good just for her.

## On marriage

+ giammacool@x -- Ladies, If you’re thinking, «I don’t recognize the man I married, I’m not attracted to him anymore», Consider this… Pointing out everything he does wrong daily changes a man. A man who is constantly torn down will naturally pull away. If you’re not building him up daily, you’re setting yourself up for your own downfall, and worse, you’re not protecting your man.
+ giammacool@x -- Nothing is more attractive to a man than your willingness to adopt his last name. Either way, your last name is either your husband’s or your father’s. So, claiming you want to keep your last name isn’t strictly accurate.
> *"You can tell the health of a marriage by how often the wife posts selfies."  -- mc_shortyy@x*

- A man would marry a poor woman as long as she’s loyal. A woman would marry a cheating man as long as he’s rich.
- A submissive wife can make you richer than a career woman.
- I want to be wanted, but not needed. I should be the one pushing for commitment. I want to have the feeling that I make a great deal, because he's of higher value than me.
- We are not avoiding marriage, we are avoiding divorce.

## On science

<!--
- athenian and italian city states and free form usa were hotbeds for innovation. there was lot of competition.
- enlightment was a revolution in how people sought knowledge : by trying not to rely on authorithy.
- future proof by avoiding dedicated hardware
- if you cannot question it, it’s not science, it’s propaganda.
- look at ideas individually not at the ism
- making something social destroys truth of it because social groups need consensus to survive - otherwise they fight and can’t get along - and consensus is all about truth seeking.
- Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on.
- science transforms raw materials (resources) into civilization.
- social sciences need to appeal to society for funding so they are politically motivated.
- the real diversity that matters is diversity of ideas not diversity of skin color.
- the world as your lab. if you do stuff scientifically you can do it right next time also
- theories are explanations, not predictions. prediction comes after the explanation
- theories are not derived from anything. human minds crete them by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing ideias. we guess.
- trust the science is the most anti-science statement ever. questioning science is how you do science.
- wild west, the frontire is always filled with crime and scams and weid stuff and people but it’s where innovation occurs also.

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it’s a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .
3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.
4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.
7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.
8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.
9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.
10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.
11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.
12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.
13. Design is based on requirements. There’s no justification for designing something one bit "better" than the requirements dictate.
16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.
17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.
20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.
23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.
27. (Varsi’s Law) Schedules only move in one direction.
29. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.
30. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist’s concept.
31. (Mo’s Law of Evolutionary Development) You can’t get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.
32. (Atkin’s Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don’t show up.
33. (Patton’s Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
34. (Roosevelt’s Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
35. (de Saint-Exupery’s Law of Design) A designer knows that they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
37. (Henshaw’s Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame.
40. (McBryan’s Law) You can’t make it better until you make it work.
41. There’s never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there’s always enough time to do it over.
43. You really understand something the third time you see it (or the first time you teach it.)
44. (Lachance’s Law) "Plenty of time" becomes "not enough time" in a very short time.

-- Charles Bukowski [1920]*

> *"To be an artist, you have to give up everything, including the desire to be a good artist."  
-- Jasper Johns [1930]*

### On aesthetics

<!--
- our goal is to discover the beauty that is held within the age of upcycling.

> *"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."  
-- Antoine de Saint Exupery [1900]*

Most people with good taste are young and poor.

The more «art» you allow in, the less commercial success you’ll have. People don’t want «art» they want entertainment. 

> *"There is no exquisite beauty without some strangeness in the proportion."  
-- Edgar Allan Poe [1809]*

> *"Sharpness is a bourgeois concept."  
-- Henri Cartier-Bresson [1908]*

> *"Simplicity is a great virtue but it requires hard work to achieve it and education to appreciate it. And to make matters worse: complexity sells better."  
-- Edsger Dijkstra [1930]*

> *"Limit everything to the essential but do not remove the poetry."  
-- Dieter Rams [1932]*

> *"Form follows profit is the aesthetic principle of our times."  
-- Richard Rogers [1933]*

> *"Good taste is easy. What’s challenging is to be close to vulgarity."  
-- Adam Caruso [1962]*

## On design

> *"Good design: is innovative; makes a product useful; is aesthetic; makes a product understandable; is unobtrusive; is honest; is long-lasting; is thorough, down to teh last detail; is environmental friendly; is as little design as possible."  
-- Dieter Rams {Ten principles for good design} [1932]*

## On media

<!--
> *"Good rule of thumb: those who frequently use the word «disinformation» are the ones most likely to be pushing it."  -- elonmusk@x*
> *"Broadcast TV is not designed for you; it’s designed for advertisers.*
> *"Freedom of the press is for those who happen to own one.*

- engagement media
- Instagram: where average people pretend to be millionaires. Twitter: where millionaires pretend to be average people.
-->

> *"Journalism is printing what someone else doesn’t want printed. Everything else is public relations."  
-- George Orwell [1903]*

News are the first draft of History but he human brain was not designed to process all of the world’s emergencies in realtime. Journalism is now activism. It’s the only way to get eyeballs. Media companies harvest your attention and transform it into revenue. 

> *"The clash of ideas is the sound of freedom."  
-- Lady Bird Johnson [1912]*

> *"Your job is to get your audience to care about your obsessions."  
-- Martin Scorsese [1942]*

> *"The goal of media is to make every problem, your problem." (...)  
"Journalists aren’t neutral, they’re the cavalry of culture wars." (...)  
"All new information starts as misinformation." (...)  
"The more people in the conversation the harder it becomes to speak the unconfortable truth. Social media puts everybody in the same conversation." (...)  
"Elon’s purchase of Twitter was the single most consequential act of the last decade. It restored free speech, broke the Overton window, and enabled the second American revolution." (...)
"If you’re writing for your followers, your followers are worthless."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"The hallmark of modern society is the theft of attention. Modern society is overcrowded with thieves of attention." (...)  
"Social media holds up a magnifying mirror to our emotions. AI holds up a magnifying mirror to our intellectual abilities."  
-- rapahelz@x*

> *"The media is always accurate, except when they are talking about things I know."  
-- Knoll’s law*

### On privacy

Privacy is power. What people don’t know they can’t ruin.

## On maths, computers and AI

<!--
- 20 years ago, the Internet was an escape from the real world. Today, the real world is an escape from the Internet.
- 90% of webapps are database frontends.
- a fundamental rule of technology: There is no third ecosystem
- Anytime machine learning is working quietly in the background, it almost always shows up as a feed in the front-end design
- being relevant in the age of LLMs is really hard. what’s left for humans? the physical world and providing news to the LLM.
- blockchains are not personal-computing operational systems; they are social systems.
- chatgpt is a blurry jpeg of the web. openai chatbot offers paraphrases, whereas google offers quotes. which do we prefer.
- hash is a fingerprint of an amount of information. SHA256 -> 64 characters
- llms are essentially connection machines trained to find the linkages between concepts. ai is like an autocorrect system on steroids.
- physics is the only law, everything else is a recommendation
- There is no cloud. It’s just someone else’s computer.
- Top dev skills: Ability to ignore new tools and technologies; Taste for simplicity; Good code deletion skills; Humility.

alan perlis - 1. One man’s constant is another man’s variable.
alan perlis - 21. Optimization hinders evolution.
alan perlis - 58. Fools ignore complexity. Pragmatists suffer it. Some can avoid it. Geniuses remove it.
alan perlis - 105. You can’t communicate complexity, only an awareness of it.
alan perlis - 120. Adapting old programs to fit new machines usually means adapting new machines to behave like old ones.

> *"We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins."  
-- Ellen Ullman [1949]*

We’ve grown dependent on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.

> *"As far as the laws of mathematics refer to reality, they are not certain, as far as they are certain, they do not refer to reality."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"Computers are useless. They can only give you answers."  
-- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

> *"If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is."  
-- John von Neumann [1903]*

> *"Man is the best computer we can put aboard a spacecraft ...and the only one that can be mass produced with unskilled labor."  
-- Wernher von Braun [1912]*

> *"Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost. Rigor should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere."  
-- William S. Anglin [1916]*

> *"Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  
-- Arthur C. Clarke [1917]*

> *"I’ve finally learned what «upward compatible» means. It means we get to keep all our old mistakes."  
-- Dennie van Tassel [1939]*

> *"Real mathematicians understand completeness, real philosophers understand incompleteness, the rest don’t formally understand anything."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"One of the biggest mistakes we made was trying to automate things that are super easy for a person to do, but super hard for a computer to do." (...)  
"We’re already cyborgs. Your phone and your computer are extensions of you, but the interface is through finger movements or speech, which are very slow." (...)  
"When I was a little kid, I was really scared of the dark. But then I came to understand, dark just means the absense of photons in the visible wavelenght - 400 to 700 nanometers. Then I thought, well, it’s really silly to be afraid of a lack of photons. Then I wasn’t afraid of the dark anymore after that."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

### On AI

> *"With large language models we have externalized and formalized our unconscious — even our collective unconscious."  
-- Jordan Peterson [1962]*

> *"AI won’t replace programmers, but rather make it easier for programmers to replace everyone else." (...)  
"Automation means not having to do anything twice. Automation with the Internet means not having to do anything that anyone else has already done. All that remains are creativity and judgement."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Humans raise the ceiling, AI raises the floor"  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

> *"Humans are an API to ChatGPT. ChatGPT is an API to Python. Python is an API to C. C is an API to assembly. Assembly is an API to binary. Binary is an API to physics. Physics is an API to the machine that runs the universe. It’s computation all the way down."  
-- lexfridman@x*

> *"Humans doing the hard jobs on minimum wage while the robots write poetry and paint is not the future I wanted."  
-- karlremarks@x*

> *"Scarier the AI the higher the valuations."  
-- samoburja@x*

> *"Ultimately, we will end up with an AI that is omnipresent, omniscient, and omnipotent. Maybe we have to admit that we are in the process of building some sort of god." (...)  
"The three epochs of the Internet use: 1. Sort knowledge (e.g. Yahoo). 2. Search knowledge (e.g. Google). 3. Synthesize knowledge (e.g. ChatGPT)"  
-- rapahelz@x*

> *"AI doesn’t replace intelligence. It replaces effort."
