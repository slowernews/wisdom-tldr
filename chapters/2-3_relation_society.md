# 2.3 - On society

## On society and politics

<!--
> *"When a society loses its moral compass, it collapses from within."  -- G.K. Chesterton [1874]*
+ x@kunalb11 -- Easiest way to build a tribe is to convince a group of people that their current misfortune is not due to their choices but instead due to presence and actions of another group.
+ @naval -- The game theory of autonomous drones is similar to the game theory of nuclear weapons - with MAD, doomsday devices, and first /second strike, but scaled down to individuals. We are entering the age of “if you can see it, you can kill it.” Anonymity is the best defense.
> *"Drone proliferation will democratize Mutually Assured Destruction and possibly lead to an uneasy peace."  -- x@naval*
> *"Mass drone manufacturing capability is the new nuclear weapon."  -- x@naval*
> *"Any country that can’t manufacture its own drones will be a vassal state."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*
> *"America is forged by immigrants and descendants of immigrants. Self-selecting for the American Dream. Choosing freedom over safety, opportunity over handouts, prosperity over equality"  -- x@naval*
> *"Angry people vote, the apathetic stay home. Trump has to make you angry at the state of affairs. Kamala has to make you angry at Trump."  -- x@naval*
> *"Free speech is how you spot the errors, voting is how you fix them, and staying armed is how you keep those rights."  -- x@naval*
> *"It’s nationalists vs communists from here on out."  -- x@naval*
> *"It’s the battle of the masculine men and the feminine women vs the masculine women and the feminine men."  -- x@naval*
> *"Libertarianism can only emerge in the cocoon of a functioning, high-trust republic."  -- x@naval*
> *"Local environmentalism is real. Global environmentalism is performative."  -- x@naval*
> *"Tech is the accelerator, regulation is the brake."  -- x@naval*
> *"Technology breeds collectivism, because it increases leverage, and therefore the gap between winners and losers."  -- x@naval*
> *"The greatest threats to the future are suppression of freedom of speech—freedom of mathematics, freedom of expression, and freedom of creation. And those are pointless if they can’t be backed up by violence. If you don’t have your own ability to inflict violence, it will be taken away from you. One recent tweet I had said, “The right to vote does not give you power. Power gives you the right to vote." You can just do a simple thought exercise: If there were a hundred of us on a desert island and we’re trapped, and we all kind of have to cooperate to create a new society. Suppose there are 10 people on the island who are all from the same ethnic background, who are all extremely unified, and they have all the guns. Those 10 have it, the other 90 don’t. Who do you think is going to end up running the place “for the benefit of the others"? Anyone who’s been around the block a few times knows what’s going to happen. So it’s just the nature of humans that if you want freedom at the individual level, if you want the rights to be dispersed and distributed, the power has to be dispersed and distributed. And there’s very few institutions and organizations that do that. Really, it’s the right to bear arms, cryptography, free speech, mathematics, personal computing. These are examples of decentralized technologies and capabilities that spread power amongst people. Most things concentrate power."  -- x@naval*
> *"The distant future is small free cities with drone armies and skill-based immigration policies, surrounded by a sea of failed socialist states."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*
> *"The end state of all vehicles is autonomous. The end state of all military hardware is drones."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*
> *"The struggle between collectivists and individualists is as old as humanity."  -- x@naval*
> *"Vote to protect the American dream of equal opportunity, not a Marxist fantasy of equal outcome."  -- x@naval*
> *"A candidate is a person who gets money from the rich and votes from the poor to protect them from each other.*
> *"A constitution is an algorithm for running a country."  -- Pedro Domingos [1965]*
> *"A culture is a co-operating system for humans."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*
> *"A country’s assets reside in the tinkerers, the hobbyists, and the risk-takers."  -- Nassim Taleb [1960]*
> *"America innovates, China replicates, Europe regulates."  -- Pedro Domingos [1965]*
> *"Be wary of any word that ends with “ism”. More often than not, "ism" at the end of a word suggests the word is related to a frozen system of ideas that forgot the original questioning that gave rise to it, i.e. an ideology. Ideologies are the graveyards of ideas."  -- x@rapahelz*
> *"Europe was created by history. America was created by philosophy."  -- Margaret Thatcher*
> *"Ideologues often become so captivated by an abstract ideal of humanity that they cease to care about actual humans."  -- x@g_s_bhogal*
> *"If majority of academics vote Democrat, it is not random: they  1) don’t have skin in the game, (others take risks for them) 2) are not productive members of society but want to lecture others on what to do 3) have steady income etc."  -- Nassim Taleb [1960]*
> *"It doesn’t matter what you do, it only matters what you say you’ve done and what you’re going to do.*
> *"It is amazing that people who think we cannot afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, and medication somehow think that we can afford to pay for doctors, hospitals, medication and a government bureaucracy to administer it." -- Thomas Sowell [1930]*
> *"O comunismo penetrou até mesmo nos circulos cristãos disfarçado de solidariedade. É nosso dever pastoral expô-lo."  -- Robert Francis Prevost (Papa Leão XIV em 2010)
> *"Tech giants want to be regulated because they want to hand off the unpopular decisions to governments."  -- Pedro Domingos [1965]*
> *"The liberty of a democracy is not safe if the people tolerate the growth of private power to a point where it becomes stronger than their democratic State itself. That, in its essence, is Fascism -- ownership of government by an individual, by a group or by any controlling private power."  -- FDR*

- As humans, we are tribal by nature. Our natural default is to see ourselves as part of some group that’s struggling against some other group(s) at all times. And once we’re part of our little group, our little tribe, we adopt all sorts of biases and preferences. We construct belief systems that justify our group’s power and superiority. We create tests of whether other people are “true” and “pure” members of our group, and we either shame any “non-believers” into conformity or simply expel them from the tribe.

- When the state is absent the patriots become the state.
- Youthful male energy is the lifeblood of revolution. The campaign against young men isn’t about preventing misogyny - it’s about preventing regime change.
And once your philosophy has inverted upon itself, it becomes corrupt. Just like the old communist societies of the 20th century, once you set out to provide perfect equality for everybody, you achieve the exact opposite. What was once progressive becomes regressive. You become so busy policing people’s thoughts and opinions that you lose track of what actually matters.
But the problem is that, like I said, feminism, in the process of enacting all of the progress of the last 50 years, became more than a philosophy—it became an institution. And institutions are always primarily interested in sustaining themselves first and engaging with the world as it is second.
Once a philosophy goes tribal, its beliefs no longer exist to serve some moral principle, but rather they exist to serve the promotion of the group.
The way you destroy stereotypes is by being the contradiction of the stereotype. These are the real activists. This is where real progress happens. Yes, women still face stereotypes and poor treatments in these industries. But this is the trench today’s feminists should be fighting in. This is where they should be making their push -- and not by talking about it online, but by actually being there.

In case of doubt, vote against. By this rule you will rarely go wrong. If this is too blind for your taste, consult some well-meaning fool (there is always one around) and ask his advice.

-- Thomas Paine [1737]*

> *"A democracy cannot exist as a permanent form of government. It can only exist until the people discover they can vote themselves largess out of the public treasury.

### On politicians

> *"90% of the politicians give the other 10% a bad reputation."  
-- Henry Kissinger [1923]*

Politicians hate risk. Decisions are made on the lowest risk of offending people, specially their voters.

Hints:

- Politicians don’t get educated, they get bought.
- The opposite of corruption is patriotism. To reduce corruption diminish people involved on analogic processes.
- Taxes are a membership fee that most of us are voluntarily overpaying.
- Inequality is a problem. Equality is not the solution. That’s the dilemma.
- Changes from within are more sustainable than revolutions. We don’t need great individuals, we need institutions that work.
- Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.
- The moment you cross a second border, you are an economic migrant, not a refugee.
- Multicultural is by absurdum the true monocultural.

> *"The price of apathy towards public affairs is to be ruled by evil men." (...)

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"People who believe politicians care about them are the same people who think OnlyFans girls care about them."  
-- x@stirlingwisdom*

### On voting

> *"Anyone who claims that their political party does no wrong and the other party does no right is either a liar, a fool or both."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

> *"Voting is the adult version of writing a letter to Santa Claus."  
-- x@stirlingwisdom*

### Left right

> *"The left is morally driven to hate inequality and finds itself opposing human nature, free markets, and evolution. The right is the ragtag coalition of people that want to be left alone - merchants, nationalists, the religious, libertarians. What unifies the right is the left."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### On equality

> *"One of the sad signs of our times is that we have demonized those who produce, subsidized those who refuse to produce, and canonized those who complain."  -- Thomas Sowell [1930]*

> *"Until we have a vaccine against wokeism, social distancing is the best solution."  
-- Pedro Domingos [1965]*

> *"Socialism is the suicide pact of mediocrity." (...)  
"The West is in an existential struggle between equality and excellence."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"The reason only leftists commit acts of terrorism and tear things down is simple: destruction is easy, building is hard. if they could build anything worth something, they wouldn’t be leftists in the first place. leftism is the ideology of those who failed at creation, resentment turned into politics. they despise excellence and beauty because they can’t achieve it, so they sabotage what others create. no one able to build something stays leftist for long, success cures that delusion fast."  
-- x@iterintellectus*

> *"Diversity at the local level means homogeneity at the global level. Homogeneity at the local level means diversity at the global level. Nationalism preserves diversity. Globalism destroys it."  
-- x@pandemicriskman*

### on immigration

> *"Immigration is a privilege, not a right, and the safety of our citizens must come first, without question."  
-- Donald J. Trump [1946]*

> *"My immigration policy: anyone who agrees with me is welcome into the country. Anyone who does not, is not."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"High-paying low-skill jobs are the real social safety net. Immigrants taking these jobs and lowering their wages is terrible for Americans."  
-- x@jlippincott_*

### On bureaucracy

> *"The first responsibility of any bureaucracy is the preservation of itself. The second is to expand its responsiblities."  
-- Morton Halperin [1934]*

When a politician says "threat to our democracy". They really mean threat to their corrupt bureaucracy.

> *"It is much more important to kill bad bills, than to pass good ones."  
-- Calvin Coolidge [1872]*

> *"When you have an efficient government, you have a dictatorship."  
-- Harry Truman [1884]*

> *"A memorandum is written not to inform the reader, but to protect the writer."  
-- Dean Acheson [1893]*

> *"A government that is big enough to give you all you want is big enough to take it all away."  
-- Barry Goldwater [1909]*

> *"Thank God we don’t get all the government we pay for."  
-- Milton Friedman [1912]*

> *"The purpose of politics is not to solve problems but to find problems to justify the expansion of government power and an increase in taxes." (...)  
"You will never understand bureaucracies until you understand that for bureaucrats procedure is everything and outcomes are nothing."  
-- Thomas Sowell [1930]*

> *"Bureaucracy is a construction designed to maximize the distance between a decision-maker and the risks of the decision." 
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"If I fully destroy the corruption, they will kill me."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

> *"Bureaucracy = Culture of submission. Innovation = Culture of subversion. Hence the antagonism."  
-- x@rapahelz*

### On inequality and taxes

> *"To be wealthy and honored in an unjust society is a disgrace."  
-- Confucius [-551]*

> *"The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal."  
-- Aristotle [-384]*

> *"Favors granted always become defined as rights."  
-- Saul Alinsky [1909]*

> *"If you cannot achieve equality of performance among people born to the same parents and raised under the same roof, how realistic is it to expect to achieve it across broader and deeper social divisions." (...)  
"When people get used to preferential treatment, equal treatment feels like discrimination." (...)  
"What’s exactly your «fair share» of what «someone else» has worked for?" (...)  
"I have never understood why it is «greed» to want to keep the money you have earned but not greed to want to take somebody else’s money."  
-- Thomas Sowell [1930]*

> *"When the state calls you a taxpayer is equivalent to a rapist calling his victim his girlfriend."  
-- Javier Milei [1970]*

> *"The real tax is society forcing otherwise productive people to pay attention to politics."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]* 

### On wokeism

<!--
- Um socialista honesto não entende de Economia. Um socialista que entende de economia não é honesto. Um homem honesto que entende de Economia não é socialista.
-->

> *"Far-right are nostalgic for a world that never was. Far-left are hopeful for a world that can never be."  
-- x@g_s_bhogal*

Wokeness is the belief that every disparity is rooted in discrimination. Worldview that believes that all interactions are about power. There is only one conflict in the world, and it is the powerful against the powerless, where the powerful are trying to preserve their power (this is called «intersectionality»)

> *"The Party told you to reject the evidence of your eyes and ears. It was their final, most essential command."  
-- George Orwell [1903]*

> *"Much of the social history of the Western world over the past three decades has involved replacing what worked with what sounded good."  
-- Thomas Sowell [1930]*

> *"The axiomatic error undermining much of Western Civilization is “weak makes right”. If someone accepts, explicitly or implicitly, that the oppressed are always the good guys, then the natural conclusion is that the strong are the bad guys."  
-- Elon Musk [1971]*

> *"The people who start the wars don’t fight them, the people who spend the taxes don’t pay them, and the people who forgive the criminals don’t live next to them. Of course we’re going to have too many wars, too much spending, and too much crime." (...)  
> *"The average man lives in a matriarchy, the average woman lives in a patriarchy, and they’re both correct."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### On diversity

The real diversity that matters is the diversity of ideas, not the diversity of skin color.

> *"Racism is not dead, but it is on life support — kept alive by politicians, race hustlers, and people who get a sense of superiority by denouncing others as «racists.»" (...)  
"Our children and grandchildren may yet curse the day we began hyping race and ethnicity. There are countries where that has led to slughters in the streets but you cannot name a country where it has led to greater harmony." (...)  
"What «multiculturalism» boils down to is that you can praise any culture in the world except Western culture - and you cannot blame any culture in the world except Western culture."  
-- Thomas Sowell [1930]*

> *"I don’t want a Black History Month. Black history is American history. How are we going to get rid of racism? Stop talking about it!"  
-- Morgan Freeman [1937]*

### On nations

> *"the disappearance of nations would have impoverished us no less than if all men had become alike, with one personality and one face. Nations are the wealth of mankind, its collective personalities; the very least of them wears its own special colours and bears within itself a special facet of divine intention."  
-- Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn [1918]*

### On freedom

<!--
- Liberdade sem propriedade é ilusao. Diz me quanto tens poupado em dias de consumo pessoal e eu digo te quantos dias tens de liberdade.
-->

> *"I never believed that man’s freedom consisted in doing what he wants, but rather in never doing what he does not want to do."  
-- Jean-Jacques Rousseau [1712]*

> *"The Tree of Liberty must, from time to time, be watered with the blood of patriots."  
-- Thomas Jefferson [1743]*

> *"People demand freedom of speech as a compensation for the freedom of thought which they seldom use."  
-- Soren Kierkegaard [1813]*

> *"The best way to keep a prisoner from escaping is to make sure he never knows he’s in prison."  
-- Fyodor Dostoyevsky [1821]*

> *"The clash of ideas is the sound of freedom."  
-- Lady Bird Johnson [1912]*

> *"I would rather have questions that can’t be answered than answers that can’t be questioned."  
-- Richard Feynman [1918]*

## On following the herd

> *"Mimicking the herd, invites regression to the mean."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

Society is run by peer pressure, not intelligence.

Most people are other people. People accept the defaults very easily. Our thoughts are someone else opinions and we jump to conclusions. Our insecurities drive us to excess and overcompensation. We are, at heart, animals and we are easily manipulated, especially in groups.

Groups of people behave differently than individuals. The larger the crowd, the less responsibility people have for their behaviour. This effect is known as mob behaviour. This is also why individuals should make decisions. Groups never admit failure.

### On stupidity

> *"Stupidity is overlooking or dismissing crucial information."  
-- Adam Robinson [1955]*

Stupidity is the cost of intelligence operating in a complex environment and it’s almost inevitable. Most people don’t actually think, they just take their first thought and go. There are no smart people or stupid people, just people being smart or being stupid. Being smart means thinking things through trying to find the real answer, not the first answer. Being stupid means avoiding thinking by jumping to conclusions. Jumping to a conclusion is like quitting a game: you lose by default. That’s why saying «I don’t know» is usually smart, because it’s refusing to jump to a conclusion. So when someone says «They are so stupid!», it means they’ve stopped thinking.

It’s easier to recognise stupidity in others than ourselves but don’t take for granted that others are acting stupid. Common sense is not so common.

### How to judge someone?

<!--
- my perception of you is a reflection of me
-->

> *"Judge a man by his questions, not by his answers."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

We judge ourselves by our thoughts but society judges us by what we can do for them.

Hints:

- When you don’t create things, you become defined by your tastes rather than ability.
- Every word someone says is the tip of the iceberg. Underneath that word are thoughts, fears, emotions. Underneath those emotions is history and experiences. A single word is the final outcome of all of that history.
- Judge people on their habits.

## On science

<!--
- athenian and italian city states and free form usa were hotbeds for innovation. there was lot of competition.
- enlightment was a revolution in how people sought knowledge : by trying not to rely on authorithy.
- future proof by avoiding dedicated hardware
- if you cannot question it, it’s not science, it’s propaganda.
- look at ideas individually not at the ism
- making something social destroys truth of it because social groups need consensus to survive - otherwise they fight and can’t get along - and consensus is all about truth seeking.
- Money is a shared belief. So is a border. So are bitcoins. The list goes on.
- science transforms raw materials (resources) into civilization.
- social sciences need to appeal to society for funding so they are politically motivated.
- the real diversity that matters is diversity of ideas not diversity of skin color.
- the world as your lab. if you do stuff scientifically you can do it right next time also
- theories are explanations, not predictions. prediction comes after the explanation
- theories are not derived from anything. human minds crete them by rearranging, combining, altering and adding to existing ideias. we guess.
- trust the science is the most anti-science statement ever. questioning science is how you do science.
- wild west, the frontire is always filled with crime and scams and weid stuff and people but it’s where innovation occurs also.

1. Engineering is done with numbers. Analysis without numbers is only an opinion.
2. To design a spacecraft right takes an infinite amount of effort. This is why it’s a good idea to design them to operate when some things are wrong .
3. Design is an iterative process. The necessary number of iterations is one more than the number you have currently done. This is true at any point in time.
4. Your best design efforts will inevitably wind up being useless in the final design. Learn to live with the disappointment.
7. At the start of any design effort, the person who most wants to be team leader is least likely to be capable of it.
8. In nature, the optimum is almost always in the middle somewhere. Distrust assertions that the optimum is at an extreme point.
9. Not having all the information you need is never a satisfactory excuse for not starting the analysis.
10. When in doubt, estimate. In an emergency, guess. But be sure to go back and clean up the mess when the real numbers come along.
11. Sometimes, the fastest way to get to the end is to throw everything out and start over.
12. There is never a single right solution. There are always multiple wrong ones, though.
13. Design is based on requirements. There’s no justification for designing something one bit "better" than the requirements dictate.
16. The previous people who did a similar analysis did not have a direct pipeline to the wisdom of the ages. There is therefore no reason to believe their analysis over yours. There is especially no reason to present their analysis as yours.
17. The fact that an analysis appears in print has no relationship to the likelihood of its being correct.
20. A bad design with a good presentation is doomed eventually. A good design with a bad presentation is doomed immediately.
23. The schedule you develop will seem like a complete work of fiction up until the time your customer fires you for not meeting it.
27. (Varsi’s Law) Schedules only move in one direction.
29. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Program Management) To get an accurate estimate of final program requirements, multiply the initial time estimates by pi, and slide the decimal point on the cost estimates one place to the right.
30. (von Tiesenhausen’s Law of Engineering Design) If you want to have a maximum effect on the design of a new engineering system, learn to draw. Engineers always wind up designing the vehicle to look like the initial artist’s concept.
31. (Mo’s Law of Evolutionary Development) You can’t get to the moon by climbing successively taller trees.
32. (Atkin’s Law of Demonstrations) When the hardware is working perfectly, the really important visitors don’t show up.
33. (Patton’s Law of Program Planning) A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan next week.
34. (Roosevelt’s Law of Task Planning) Do what you can, where you are, with what you have.
35. (de Saint-Exupery’s Law of Design) A designer knows that they have achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
37. (Henshaw’s Law) One key to success in a mission is establishing clear lines of blame.
40. (McBryan’s Law) You can’t make it better until you make it work.
41. There’s never enough time to do it right, but somehow, there’s always enough time to do it over.
43. You really understand something the third time you see it (or the first time you teach it.)
44. (Lachance’s Law) "Plenty of time" becomes "not enough time" in a very short time.

## On maths and computers

<!--
- 90% of webapps are database frontends. - Anytime machine learning is working quietly in the background, it almost always shows up as a feed in the front-end design
- hash is a fingerprint of an amount of information. SHA256 -> 64 characters
- Top dev skills: Ability to ignore new tools and technologies; Taste for simplicity; Good code deletion skills; Humility.
- There is no cloud. It’s just someone else’s computer. / a fundamental rule of technology: There is no third ecosystem
- blockchains are not personal-computing operational systems; they are social systems.
- chatgpt is a blurry jpeg of the web. openai chatbot offers paraphrases, whereas google offers quotes. which do we prefer. llms are essentially connection machines trained to find the linkages between concepts. ai is like an autocorrect system on steroids.

> *"We build our computer (systems) the way we build our cities: over time, without a plan, on top of ruins."  
-- Ellen Ullman [1949]*

We’ve grown dependent on three simple features that just aren’t available in the analog world: search, sort and filter.

-- Wernher von Braun [1912]*

> *"Mathematics is not a careful march down a well-cleared highway, but a journey into a strange wilderness, where the explorers often get lost. Rigor should be a signal to the historian that the maps have been made, and the real explorers have gone elsewhere."

-- Jordan Peterson [1962]*

Being relevant in the age of LLMs is really hard. What’s left for humans? The physical world and providing news to the LLM.

-->

> *"Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do."  
-- Donald Knuth [1938]*

Art is just another form of screaming, it should confort the disturbed and disturb the confortable.

Art is a meditation and design is a negotiation. Life imitates art. Creators don’t separate from their work, because they are their work.

Artistic death is made by consensus.

> *"The merit of originality is not novelty; it is sincerity."  
-- Thomas Carlyle [1795]*

> *"Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away."  
-- Antoine de Saint Exupery [1900]*

Most people with good taste are young and poor.

The more «art» you allow in, the less commercial success you’ll have. People don’t want «art» they want entertainment.

> *"Freedom of the press is for those who happen to own one.*
"If you’re writing for your followers, your followers are worthless."  -- naval

> *"Journalism is printing what someone else doesn’t want printed. Everything else is public relations."  
-- George Orwell [1903]*

News are the first draft of History but he human brain was not designed to process all of the world’s emergencies in realtime. Journalism is now activism. It’s the only way to get eyeballs. Media companies harvest your attention and transform it into revenue. 

> *"Your job is to get your audience to care about your obsessions."  
-- Martin Scorsese [1942]*
