# 3.1 - On preparing action

## On creativity

<!--
> *"Imagination should be used not to escape reality, but to create it."  -- Colin Wilson*
> *"When dreams become more important than reality, you give up travel, building, creating; you even forget how to repair the machines left behind by your ancestors. You just sit living and reliving other lives left behind in the thought records."  -- Vina, "The Menagerie" ("The Cage"), stardate unknown*
> *"Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may *not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any body.*
> *"The best defense against logic is ignorance.*

- If you want new ideas read old books.
- Be creative: Creativity conquers jealousy, envy, self-pity and worry. 52 approaches in a year is more than most men make in a lifetime. Consistency is everything. e.g. water, blueberries, green tea, avocados, leafy green vegetables, fatty fish, water, dark chocolate, flax seeds and nuts
- destruição criativa
-->

> *"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

Creative minds are rarely tidy. We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. More than addition, creativity is subtraction.

> *"What is now proved, was once only imagined."  
-- William Blake [1757]*

> *"To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

> *"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent. Curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism, have brought me to my ideas." (...)  
"Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited to all we now know and understand, while imagination embraces the entire world, and all there ever will be to know and understand." (...)  
"Creativity is intelligence having fun."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"Everything you can imagine is real." (...)  
"I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else."  
-- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

> *"A pile of rocks ceases to be a rock when somebody contemplates it with the idea of a cathedral in mind."  
-- Antoine de Saint Exupery [1900]*

> *"Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing."  
-- Salvador Dali [1904]*

> *"Creativity is thinking up new things. Innovation is doing new things."  
-- Theodore Levitt [1925]*

> *"Negativity is the enemy of creativity."  
-- David Lynch [1946]*

> *"I don’t dream at night, I dream all day. I dream for a living."  
-- Steven Spielberg [1946]*

> *"Good artists copy; great artists steal."  
-- (popularized by) Steve Jobs [1955]*

> *"Chaos is needed for innovation. Structure makes those ideas useful." (...)  
"The ability to see order in chaos is called creativity."  
-- Simon Sinek [1973]*

> *"One’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."  
-- Oliver Wendell Holmes*

> *"When nothing is sure, everything is possible."  
-- Margaret Drabble*

### How to find good ideas?

> *"The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away."  
-- Linus Pauling [1901]*

Best ideas come from the market, not from you. Changes in the environment unlock opportunities.

Creativity is a muscle. Without new experiences, it atroffiates. Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Ignorance is a blessing, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Conventional people living conventional lives lead to conventional ideas.

> *"Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"All truly great thoughts are conceived by walking."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"Nearly every man who develops an idea works it up to the point where it looks impossible, and then he gets discouraged. That’s not the place to become discouraged."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

> *"If you want a new idea read an old book."  
-- Ivan Pavlov & others [1849]*

> *"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them." (...)  
"The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours."  
-- Amos Tversky [1937]*

> *"Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Using creativity to solve problems cannot be taught, and it’s ultimately what free markets pay for." (...)  
"A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to create anything great."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process."  
-- Josh Waitzkin [1976]*

### How to judge ideas?

Ask peers. Managers will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

However the right idea not executed is worth nothing and a mediocre one well executed can be worth much. So focus on transforming yourself into the kind of person who can bring them to life. 

> *"A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right man’s brow."  
-- Ovid [-039]*

> *"In order to attain the impossible, one must attempt the absurd."  
-- Miguel de Cervantes [1547]*

> *"There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come."  
-- Victor Hugo [1802]*

> *"The man with a new idea is a crank - until the idea succeeds."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the tone of voice in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Almost all really new ideas have a certain aspect of foolishness when they are just produced."  
-- Alfred North Whitehead [1861]*

> *"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have."  
-- Émile-Auguste Chartier [1868]*

> *"If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there."  
-- F. Scott Fitzgerald [1896]*

> *"New ideas pass through three periods: 1) It can’t be done; 2) It probably can be done, but it’s not worth doing; 3) I knew it was a good idea all along!"  
-- Arthur C. Clarke [1917]*

> *"Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There’s no market for them. There’s no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn’t mean other people will copy it. First they’ll have to be convinced it’s a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else’s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they’ll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they’re more likely to do well with."  
-- Unknown*

> *"Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing."  
-- dilemma@hn*

> *"If everyone thinks it’s a good idea, you already missed the opportunity."  
-- alexhormozi@x*

## On analysis

<!--
+ rapahelz@X -- The hallmark of clear thinking is skepticism with regard to dominant narratives.
+ scottadamssays@x -- Complexity is always a cover for fraud. In every domain.
+ wordgrammer@x -- Reality is very complex. If you try to understand every situation from every possible perspective, you will spend all of your time learning, but you won’t get anything done. Biases are good.
> *"All rumors about a public figure are to be deemed untrue until he threatens to sue."  -- Nassim Taleb [1960]*
> *"All the ways of a man are clean in his own sight, but the Lord weighs the motives."  -- Proverbs 16:2*
> *"Every forecast takes a number from today and multiplies it by a story about tomorrow."  -- morganhousel@x*
> *"On a poll 79% are right. In life, 79% are usually wrong."  -- warikoo@x*

- if you want to understand how to fix a problem in the world, you have to ask who is profiting from the problem. Not who is suffering from it.
- It's less about the past men than the future men. Past actions predict future actions. Hoeing around, then getting scared and wanting to "settle down", is basically a guarantee that she has no intention of changing her behavior. She's just realizing how much she has to lie. Never forget: Your word is your power.
- We overlook major flaws in those we like. And exaggerate minor faults in those we don’t.

> *"There are no facts, only interpretations."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

Analysis is an art, not a science. The main problem with analysis is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

I don’t trust words. I even question actions. But I never doubt patterns.

"Invisible things are the only realities"  
-- Edgar Allan Poe [1809]*

> *"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"To see we must forget the name of the thing we are looking at."  
-- Claude Monet [1940]*

> *"To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense the necessity of reflection." (...)  
"It is by logic that we prove, but is by intuition that we discover."  
-- Henri Poincaré [1854]*

> *"The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"When you understand that every opinion is a vision loaded with personal history, you will begin to understand that all judgement is a confession."  
-- Nikola Tesla [1856]*

> *"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

-- George Carlin [1937]*

> *"Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I’ll tell you what you value."  
-- Joe Biden {quoting his father} [1942]*

> *"Information is useless unless you know how to interpret it."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

### Hints

<!--
> *"If you want to know how good a surgeon is, don’t ask other doctors. Ask the nurses."*

- As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths - even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision - are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth.
- Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
- if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.
- Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.
- tese antitheses -> syntesis
- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
- Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it. Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts. Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct. You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
-->

- True motivations are revealed, not declared.
- Prefer stats than narratives. We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.
- There’s always a good reason and a real reason.
- Look for something that doesn’t make sense. That’s where the gold mine is: «It doesn’t make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden. Don’t try to make sense of the world. It’s too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They’re the ones that will make the assets price move. (Adam Robinson)
- Randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.
- Skepticism is a great servant and a terrible master.
- There’s truth on *group* stereotypes. *Group* opinions self correct themselves.
- We tend to think that the people who agree with us are really smart.
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
- Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.
- «Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.
- Best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence. Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas. Too much info is the main cause of it: you’ll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs. As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.
- Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.
- Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
- Bragging razor: if someone brags assume half. if someone downplays double it.

### How to plan?

> *"Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it."  
-- René Descartes [1596]*

Start with a vision. Then look for actionable steps.

Hints:

- Plans are only a starting point. Choose a plan with options. A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality. Too detailed plans (or too general plans) are not useful and a waste of time. The most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
- Don’t sabotage them when they get tedious or too difficult.
- Actions aligned with goals.
- Quality is the best business plan.

-- Max Euwe [1901]*

> *"The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me."  
-- Ayn Rand [1905]*

> *"A strategy has a single, well defined focus. A strategy lays out a path to be followed. A strategy is made up of parts (tactics). Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus. A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally."

+ naval@x -- Decisions: If you can’t decide, the answer is no. / If two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the short term (pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality). / Choose the path that leaves you more equanimous in the long term.
+ sahilbloom@x - The worst decisions in life are made when you allow your head to talk you into something when your gut already said no.
> *"My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower."*
> *"Se não houvesse decisoes eramos todos iguais."  -- António Simões*

- a good decision is risking little for the opportunity to gain a lot. and vice-versa.
- Actions > Thoughts; Actions change the world. Not beliefs.
- As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Beliefs lag behind reality. But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
- Blue collar want to feel the same as others. White collar want to feel different from others.
- Consensus happens just in the beginning and in the end of something.
- decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no ’skin in the game’ should give estimates.
- everything is a trade-off.
- find 3 people that high expertise but that they discord and listen. take your conclusions
- for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.
- indecision comes from not knowing what you want. they don’t know what matters to them nor have found something larger then themselves to commit to.
- Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.
- Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct.
- people are punished for bad decisions and rarely rewarded for good decisions.
- the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- The Problems With Goals: Goals have an endpoint. Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. Goals can make us complacent or reckless.
- Wait 48 hours before buying stuff
- With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
- you must learn to proceed without certainty.
- Your product is decisions.

> *"May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears."  
-- Nelson Mandela [1918]*

You are evaluated by your decisions. Getting 80% good decisions is exponentially better than 70%.

We think we make choices but our choices are influenced by others. We pick what is familiar.

> *"It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago."

> *"Think of your life merely as a long sequence of actions and decisions. If you’re like most people, many of these actions and decisions are sub-optimal. And what most of us mean when we say we’d like to «change» ourselves is simply that we’d like to make slightly more optimal actions and decisions. Keep your «self» out of your decisions, because most likely, it’s not about «you». Simply ask yourself, «Is this a good thing to do?» Yes? Then go do it."

### How to speed up decisions?

> *"The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action."  
-- Daniel Gilber*

Fast decisions are a competitive advantage but most people get paralyzed by over thinking. If you don’t decide timely somebody will do it for you.

Hints:
 
- Default to no. (Steve Jobs)
- «Hell yes or no». Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. (Derek Sivers)  
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer. (Warren Buffett)  
- With two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the sort term. Pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality. (Naval Ravikant)
- Choose the one that may produce most serendipity down the line.
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, make it fast and without perfect information. If is irreversible, slow down and ensure that you understand the problem. (Jeff Bezos)
- Optimal decisions occur with 70% of the information. Anything less and you’ll probably make a bad decision. Anything more and you’re probably wasting time on something that is unlikely to change the outcome. (Jeff Bezos)

> *"All models are wrong but some are useful."  
-- George Box*

A mental model is a functional tool. If you don’t understand its limitations, you don’t understand the model. The practical question is how limited do they have to be to not be useful.

# 3.2 - On executing

## On starting and timing

<!--
> *"Many fail to finish, but many more fail to start. The hardest work in any work is to start. You can’t finish until you start, so get good at starting."*
> *"The cold water doesn’t get warmer if you jump late." 
> *"When you are stuck or overwhelmed, focus on the smallest possible thing that moves your project forward."*

- Enter action with boldness. Play the ball before it plays you. Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.
- If something compounds at 1% a day, it will be 37 times better in a year. If something loses 1% a day, it will be 0.03% of what it was in a year. I know it’s hard to quantify. It’s impossible. But the direction is what is important. It will all shake out in the end. This is the path to improvement any area of life.

- keep earning your title, or it expires. -- Derek Sivers
- monk mode -> no communication during mornings, only deep work -> meetings afternoon
- Research is not doing something. Knowledge is never the issue, action is.
- The dumbest thing smart people do: Overthink. The smartest thing dumb people do: Act.
- The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were: Start with the answer first. Group and summarize your supporting arguments. Logically order your supporting ideas. Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”
- The more “goal oriented” is the task, the more a potential 10x programmer
- The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present _exactly_3 reasons: Your argument gets their attention and is memorable. You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons. You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.

The stars will never align and the traffic lights of life will never all be green at the same time. The universe doesn’t conspire against you, but it doesn’t go out of its way to line up all the pins either. Conditions are never perfect. “Someday” is a disease that will take your dreams to the grave with you. Pro and con lists are just as bad.

### On procrastination

<!--
- i think procrastination leads to burnout much more than work does.
- Just finished the book «Buy Back Your Time». Key takeaway? Outsource your weaknesses. It isn’t lazy, it’s smart. Double down on your zone of genius and watch your business, health and life transform.
- Laziness is just a symptom of not having something worth waking up for. It’s a lack of direction. When your goals align with your passions, laziness fades away because you’re driven by something bigger than yourself. Purpose fuels progress. It’s about building something that outlasts you.
- Laziness is often disguised as a lack of knowledge.
- One pattern I’ve noticed in all miserable people: They overthink and underact.
- You’re too gifted to be paralyzed by procrastination. Dear son, I need you to focus.

-- Mark Manson [1984]*

> *"While we wait for life, life passes." (...)  
"While we are postponing, life speeds by."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

We fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all. Inadequacy of results makes us realize that we are not as good as we think we are and creates anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us. We procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety. When hope disappears, so does action. The cost of procrastination is the life you could’ve lived.

> *"Evil is whatever distracts."  
-- Franz Kafka [1883]*

How to defeat procrastination?

Hints:

- What gets measured gets done.
- Don’t wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet. You will languish if you stop for a long time and paralysis is worse than bad timing.
 At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused (the panic monster). 
- However, never mistake action for motion. You must think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought. So make a plan. Any plan will do.

> *"Start as close to the end as possible."

Direction is more important than velocity. Even if we can’t choose the starting point, often, we can choose the direction.

When possible, position yourself for victory by bringing the target closer. Location is better than space amount so trade space for time.

> *"Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success."*

Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.

-- Steve Jobs [1955]*

First the essential. Then the details.

Focusing is an art. Time itself is not your limitation: attention is. Busy imply out of control. Lack of time is lack of priorities.

-->

> *"As few as you can, as many as you must."  
-- John Stuart Mill [1806]*

Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity, it’s stupidity.

Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. Productivity is about attention management. Do less to achieve more. You don’t need to optimise everything. 20% of your effort will give you 80% of output and it may be more than enough. 

Hints:

- Protect your time like your money. Protect your hours of real work. Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Focus on one to three outcomes per day (include one important but not urgent task) and tackle the most important one in the morning. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place.
- 80/20 is fractal: If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value, 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value. So 4% of the work you do may create 64% of the benefits!
- Ruthless cut all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Always work with a specific purpose in mind. Set specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goals.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish report” might turn into “write report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- Learn to focus and being fully present on what you are doing now.
- Work by layers: from functional to excellency.
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk.
- When a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it.
- Buy yourself time: delegate. Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- To get anything done quickly, ask a busy person to do it.

### On clutter

> *"Clutter is the physical manifestation of unmade decisions fueled by procrastination."  
-- Christina Scalise*

Hints:

- Remove unnecessary distractions and obligations that aren’t truly serving your end goals. Technology is your slave, not your master. You’re not choosing ignorance, you’re choosing to not watch wrestling.
- Minimalism doesn’t avoid possession. Only excess. The less you own, the less owns you. Owning less is better than organizing more. Eliminate instead of organizing. Organizing your email is like alphabetizing your recycling. Actively declutter makes room for your true treasures and clarify your values. Do not hold on to possessions you no longer need. Storage is a way of warehousing the past. If you don’t love it or use it is clutter. Decluttering is self-care. Clutter is not just physical stuff. It’s old ideas, toxic relationships and bad habits. Clutter is everything that doesn’t support the better self.
- Use it or loose it. A tool is useful when passes human level. Start by buying the absolute cheapest tools you can find. Upgrade the ones you use a lot. If you wind up using some tool for a job, buy the very best you can afford.
- Buy supplies before you need them. Gadgets after you need them. Three is two. Two is one. One is none.
- All that clutter used to be money.

## On luck and risk

<!--
> *"I naufraghi prima o poi finiscono per incontrarsi."  -- M. Vázquez Montalban*
-->

> *"Shallow men believe in luck or in circumstance. Strong men believe in cause and effect."  
-- Ralph Waldo Emerson [1803]*

> *"If you live long enough, most people will get what they deserve."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

Unless you’re winning, life will seem unfair to you.

Bad luck is often bad planning. If you’re sure it’s not, be positive, the pendulum will swing back your way eventually. «Random» usually means that you haven’t looked long enough to see a pattern emerge. «Surprises» only happen when they didn’t repeat on one’s lifetime. Everything is a pattern.

Risk is everything you left over and didn’t thought about.

	RISK = THREATS x VULNERABILITIES

> *"The devil always takes back his gifts."  
-- Proverb*

> *"We all have enough strength to endure the misfortunes of other people."  
-- François de La Rochefoucauld [1613]*

> *"I know that history is going to be dominated by an improbable event, I just don’t know what that event will be."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Karma is just you, repeating your patterns, virtues, and flaws until you finally get what you deserve."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Risk is what’s left over when you think you’ve thought of everything."  
-- Carl Richards*

> *"What do I want to know about investing that we can’t know? The exact role of luck in successful outcomes."  
-- Robert Schiller*

### On chance

> *"Luck is what happens when preparation meets opportunity."  
-- Seneca [-004]*

Every outcome in life is guided by forces other than individual effort. The best things in life are born from coincidence. Luck is an open door. Chance is the willingness to step through. This creates the illusion that certain people are luckier.

> *"The day you decide to do it is your lucky day." (...)  
"Luck sometimes visit a fool, but it never sits down with him."  
-- Proverbs*

> *"In the realm of scientific observation, luck is granted only to those who are prepared."  
-- Louis Pasteur [1822]*

> *"Necessity is the mother of taking chances."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Opportunity is missed by most of people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work."  
-- Thomas Edison [1847]*

> *"Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far it is possible to go."  
-- T.S. Eliot [1888]*

> *"And the day came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom."  
-- Anais Nin [1903]*

> *"People who don’t take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year. People who do take risks generally make about two big mistakes a year."  
-- Peter Drucker [1909]*

> *"Opportunity dances with those on the dance floor."  
-- H. Jackson Brown Jr. [1940]*

> *"If you risk nothing, then you risk everything."

> *"Things that come with little help of luck are more resistant to randomness."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Taking risk is the ultimate expression of optimism."  
-- rapahelz@x*

### On hope and faith

> *"Hope is the bread of the poor."  
-- Proverb*

> *"Hope is a good breakfast, but it is a bad supper."  
-- Francis Bacon [1561]*

> *"Faith: not wanting to know what is true."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"Faith is patience with mystery."  
-- Richard Rohr [1943]*

> *"Hope is not a strategy."  
-- Vince Lombardi [1913]*

> *"Hope is not the conviction that something will turn out well, but the certainty that something is worth doing no matter how it turns out."  
-- Václav Havel*

## On control

<!--
> *"They say Trump is out of control, but he’s not. He’s just out of their control."  -- Tucker Carlson*
+ skylarromines@x -- Never correct anyone who’s wrong unless you’re being paid to do it. Watch quality of life improve.

- Não se pode fazer colecção de tudo.
- focus on what doesnt change
- never let the things you can’t do distract from the things you can.
- we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe. 
-->

> *"You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink."  
-- Proverb*

Disorder is not a mistake; it’s our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

Control what you can: what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on. Ignore the rest.

Consuming information gives the control freak an illusion of control. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that the universe doesn’t make sense and he doesn’t trust himself to handle disorder in a situation that will get out of his league or skillset.

> *"Sometimes people don’t want to hear the truth because they don’t want their illusions destroyed."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 

> *"One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Some of us think holding on makes us strong, but sometimes it is letting go." 
-- Hermann Hesse [1877]*

> *"If things seem under control, you’re just not going fast enough."  
-- Mario Andretti [1940]*

> *"You get pseudo-order when you seek order; you only get a measure of order and control when you embrace randomness."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"If you change the way you look at things, the thing you look at change"  
-- Wayne Dyer*

### On security

> *"If you are not in danger, do not fight."  
-- Sun Tzu [-544]*

> *"The dangers of life are infinite, and among them is safety."  
-- J.W. Goethe [1749]*

> *"Security is mostly a superstition. Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."  
-- Helen Keller [1880]*

> *"Our only security is our ability to change."  
-- John Lilly*

> *"Uncertainty is the only certainty there is, and knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security there is." 
-- John Allen Paulos*

## On balance

<!--
- alguem mais loose q tu é um maluco, mais tight é um nhónhó. somos a medida de tudo
-->

> *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

Life is a balancing act. Most things are not binary.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite. The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *"Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"The optimal zone for performance is «slightly hungry»." (...)  
"Don’t settle and don’t struggle. Life is what flows in between." (...)  
"You get paid for being right first, and to be first, you can’t wait for consensus."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It’s about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships and personal growth.

Hints:

- Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.
- There are two approaches to improving yourself: 1) The self-improvement junkie. 2) The self-improvement tourists. (Mark Manson)

> *"Where there is too much, something is missing." (...)  
"Sunshine all the time makes a desert."   
-- Proverbs*

> *"Life is a balance between holding on and letting go."  
-- Rumi [1207]*

> *"You never know what is enough until you know what is more than enough."  
-- William Blake [1757]*

### How to balance an imbalance?

Overcompensate. Some people get passion from something they struggled with.

> *"An abnormal reaction to an abnormal situation is normal behaviour."  
-- Victor Frankl [1905]*

## On change and adapting

<!--
> *"The problem is not to find the answer, it’s to face the answer."  -- Terence Mckenna*
> *"You can ignore reality, but you can’t ignore the consequences of ignoring reality."  -- Ayn Rand [1905]*
+ naval@x -- People think they can’t change themselves, but they can. People think they can change others, but they can’t.
+ omanueljoaquim@x -- Quem não generaliza, cai sempre nas provas anedóticas. Não é um erro lógico, é sobrevivência.
+ shl@x -- You can’t change someone. All you can do is understand them
+ @Rapahelz -- Behaviors that are rewarded in the zoo are suicidal in the jungle.

- when there is a problem there is an oportunity
- grow also feels like loss
- Inertia is why a car does not stop the moment the brakes are applied.
- next shot is more important than last mistake.
- regrets are especially painful when you abandon a previous plan and feel like you have to run in the other direction twice as fast to make up for lost time.
- when you hit a wrong note, it’s the next note that makes it good or bad.
-->

> *"However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"At Berkshire there has never been a master plan. Anyone who wanted to do it, we fired because it takes on a life of its own and doesn’t cover new reality. We want people taking into account new information."  
-- Charlie Munger [1924]*

> *"Life is more like tetris than chess."  
-- Tor Blair*

> *"This is the joy of the rose, that it blows, and then it goes."  
-- Willa Cather*

Plans are not static.

Switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go. If problems shift faster than your rate of adaptation you loose.

> *"At high tide the fish eats ants; at low tide the ants eat fish."  
-- Proverb*

> *"One should not be too straightforward. Go & see the forest. The straight trees are cut down, the crooked ones are left standing."

-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"Your life does not get better by chance, it gets better by change."  
-- Jim Rohn [1930]*

> *"You don’t do well by trying to be right; it is impossible for humans. You do well by figuring out when you’re wrong faster than others do."  
-- Nassim Taleb [1960]*

> *"Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth."  
-- Mike Tyson [1966]*

> *"The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:  
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;  
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.  
It’s scary to make those direction choices but fear is a great road sign."  
-- Derek Sivers (paraphrased) [1969]*

> *"The best way, perhaps the only way, to change others is to become an example." (...)  
"Everybody wants to change others. Nobody wants to be changed." (...)  
"Everybody likes to conjecture, nobody likes to correct errors." (...)  
"People think they can’t change themselves, but they can. People think they can change others, but they can’t." (...)  
"Sometimes it’s easier to change the world than to change people’s minds."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times."  
-- Everett Dirksen*

> *"What got you here won’t get you there."  
-- Marshall Goldsmith*

> *"Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more."  
-- Aldo van Eyck*

Listen to predict a collapse.

> *"When things break, it’s not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It’s because a little piece gets lost - the two remaining ends couldn’t fit together even if they wanted to. The whole shape has changed."  
-- John Green [1977]*

> *"Don’t readily ascribe to malice what can be more easily ascribed to incompetence."  
-- James Akre*

Adapt instead of reacting. An opportunity is taking an unwanted job.

> *"When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills."  
-- Proverb*

> *"Things do not change; we change."  
-- Henry David Thoreau [1817]*

> *"If I don’t have red, I use blue."  
-- Pablo Picasso [1881]*

> *"Change is inevitable, it’s our job to exploit it."  
-- Eli Goldratt*

> *"Change before you have to."  
-- Jack Welch*

### How to change?

> *"It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

There are limits on change. Willpower is finite and change requires attention. However, small changes in a complex system can cause large changes. 

> *"The secret of change is to focus all your energy, not on fighting the old, but on building the new."  
-- Socrates [-470]*

> *"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference." 
-- St. Francis of Assisi [1181]*

> *"Those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything." (...)  
"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man."  
-- George Bernard Shaw [1856]*

> *"You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a model that makes the existing model obsolete."  
-- Buckminster Fuller [1895]*

> *"Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"The key to change... is to let go of fear."

# 3.3 - On ending

## On getting advantage

<!--
> *"The most effective way to destroy people is to deny and obliterate their own understanding of their history."  -- George Orwell [1903]*
+ paulskallas@x -- Asymmetries reward those who see them first. They’re invisible rules that control your life. Most people never see them. But once you learn to spot these hidden imbalances, in your salary, your relationships, your career, you gain an unfair advantage.

- Changing the subject. Hallmark of the loser
- applying force vs removing obstacles. when you apply force you can identify obstacles. -- codie_sanchez@x*
- failing causes: group decisions / decide based on how sucessful others are deciding / asymetry of risk-reward / overdiversificaton / inertia
- What works at a small scale (say, a Utopian community), loses its effectiveness as it scales. Everything has a breakpoint. Their cheating had a small individual effect initially, so it went unnoticed. But the follow-on effect to individual cheating is group cheating, and the utopian goal of To each according to his need, from each according to his ability had the effect of expanding everyone’s needs and shrinking their ability, aided by envy and reciprocation effects.
- What’s your advantage: informational, analytical, or behavioral?	
- You must play by your rules, funnel your weird stuff to give you some advantage.

> *"Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth."  
-- Archimedes [-212]*

> *"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."  
-- Napoleon Bonaparte [1769]*

Strategy is about winning before the battle begins, tactics are about striking at weakness.

Leverage is a force multiplier. Leverage your target weaknesses to raise your chances of winning. Use methods like unpredictability, charming or mirroring. Even deceiving, some opponents may require special tools.

> *"You are strong only where you were broken." (...)  
"It’s hard to defeat a high-morale defender with an unlimited supply line." (...)  
"Leverage converts knowledge into power." (...)  
"Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
An army of robots is freely available - it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed."  
-- Richard Rumelt*

Hints:

- If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.
- Divide and conquer.
- Beware of counter-attacking: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.
- Any change require injecting more energy than is extracted by the system.
- Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.
- Drain opponent morale with unexpected defeat or unexpected strong defence.
- Every strenght has a complementary weakness.
- Look to people when they are bluffing.

- Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex, habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.
- Never trust a person who hangs out with the same people that they talk bad about.
- People only get defensive if what you’re saying about them is true.
- the best way to get someone’s attention is to stop giving them yours.
- the good reason and the real reason.
- When someone can’t use logic to make you care about the same things they care about, they resort to name-calling: sociopath, soulless, etc. But recall: misplaced empathy is why the west is falling. -- Diane Yap
-->

> *"We catch more flies with honey than vinegar." (...)  
"Abuse often starts with praise."  
-- Proverbs*

> *"To combat an adversary, become their friend."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Charm the enemy to find their weaknesses. Then exploit them.

Hints:

- People’s need for validation and recognition, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. To persuade up, focus on interests; to persuade down focus on emotions.
- Use absence and bait to attract people. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections. The ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression. use it with moderation.
- Instead of killing it, charm the snake to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. First they have to trust you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy has always to prove himself.

> *"Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear."  
-- Hannah Arendt [1906]*

If we play by the rules too strictly, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish. Fair players on shady markets usually don’t do well on the short term.

By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you. However deceiving is not lying. Lying is like a nuclear bomb, the effects will be there for a long time. Disappointment destroys trust.

> *"Poker is about maximizing deceptiveness while extracting information from your opponent."  
-- Liv Boeree*

Hints:

- It’s hard to cheat an honest opponent.
- Don’t attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness. So never be mean to anybody that can hurt you by doing nothing.
- The only time you enjoy hearing a lie is when you already know the truth.
- The only thing worth praying is truth.
- If you are in a subordinate position, unpredictability reduces trust.
- Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.
- There are 2 rules in life. nr. one: never give out all the information.

<!--
"Start by being warm, pleasant, & generous w/every person you meet; but if someone tries to exercise power over you, exercise power over him; & if he messes w/you, remember to keep messing w/him long after he has forgotten about it".  Silver Rule of Fat Tony in #SkinInTheGame"
-->

> *"Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

Reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation. We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

-->

> *"To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How? Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate."  
-- Srdja Popovic [1973]*

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

Burocracy prevents low probability events to happen at the expense of making more systems that the other people must comply and that take happiness from them.

> *"Everything will be ok in the end. If it’s not ok, it’s not the end."  
-- Proverb*

> *"If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start."  
-- Charles Bukowski [1920]*

Starting is fun but success belongs to finishers. Going halfway is a waste. Before you start something, figure out to finish it.

When the end finally comes, it comes quickly. Nothing ends poetically. It ends and we turn it into poetry. All that blood was never once beautiful. It was just red.

> *"Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance." (...)  
"You finished ahead of time, that means you forgot something." (...)  
"There are lots of overnight tragedies. There are rarely overnight miracles."

## On winning

- vencedores focam na vitoria. perdedores focam nos vencedores.

> *"Maintain reserves. A man should not employ all his capacity and power at once and on every occasion. Even in knowledge there should be a rearguard, so that your resources are doubled. One must always have something to resort to when there is fear of a defeat."  
-- Balthasar Gracian [1601]*

> *"Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is."  
-- Vince Lombardi [1913]*

It’s not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round. Winning is not the end of the road; it’s just a stop along the way.

Hints:

- Giving yourself permission to lose, automatically guarantees a loss.

> *"A fool only wins the first game."  
-- Proverb*

> *"To fight and conquer in all your battles is not supreme excellence; supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting." (...)

-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

-- George S. Patton (general) [1885]*

> *"You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"You don’t win by predicting the future; you win by getting the odds right."  
-- Will Bonner [1948]*

> *"If winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Win through your actions, never through argument."  
"Make your accomplishments seem effortless."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning."  
-- Jordan Peterson [1962]*

> *"We prefer to see winners as naturally talented rather then hard working. Because if it were reversed, what would that inply to us?"

## On quiting and surrendering

<!--
- Don’t take it personally, most people who are constantly angry are just sleep-deprived, love-deprived, or purpose-deprived.
- nem todos os problemas se resolvem c o tempo. ha jogos q so se ganha não jogando. guerra decidida pelos velhos e sofrida pelos jovens
- you only get disapointed because you had wrong opinion about someone-something. there’s no finishing line. motinvation is what happens when you’re not afraid. you reject yourself with your explantaion of what happened.
-->

> *"It only hurts when you don’t have time to prepare for the fall."  
-- Tony Hawk*

> *"Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering." (...)  
"Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere." (...)  
"You drown not by falling into a river, but by staying submerged in it."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

Letting go allows progress. Let things happen instead of trying things to happen. Accept loss. Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.

In order to come back you have to go away. Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. If you didn’t quit anything you would be still playing with toddlers. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

> *"Once the game is over, the king and the pawn go back in the same box." (...)  
"They tried to bury us. They didn’t know we were seeds."

### On forgiveness

<!--
- Good kids who do one thing wrong were punished worse than Kids who were always acting up. Infact recently 'good behaviour' from problem kids is rewarded, but nothing for the kids who aren't a problem. Sums up society in a way.
-->

> *"The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive."  
-- John Green [1977]*

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.

Forgiveness is a process of release so the opposite is a decision to hold onto something. By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.

> *"If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn’t part of ourselves doesn’t disturb us."  
-- Hermann Hesse [1877]*

> *"Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously."  
-- Hunter S. Thompson [1937]*

> *"To heal a wound you must stop scratching it."  
-- Paulo Coelho [1947]*

> *"People find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right."  
-- J.K. Rowling [1965]*

However people who forgive easily are taken for granted.

> *"I hate victims who respect their executioners."  
-- Jean-Paul Sartre [1905]*

### On memory

<!--
+ @naval -- The beginning of memory is the end of childhood.
-->

You are your memory.

However you can’t start a new chapter of your life if you keep re-reading the last one. The past may be a nice place to visit but certainly not a good place to stay. Let go your past failures. They are meant to guide you, not to define you or determine your future. Don’t be a prisoner of your past, it was just a lesson not a life sentence. The people who struggle most are the ones who can’t accept the incessant unfairness of life. They become so consumed with what should have happened, the way other people should have behaved that they become incapable of dealing with reality. Who are you becoming is more important than who you have been.

> *"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart."  
-- Steve Jobs [1955]*

You will die soon.

Act accordingly and don’t postpone joy. Live life like it’s everyone else’s last day. If you can’t find pleasure in the simple or the mundane, you won’t find it anywhere. Just because you are not where you want to be, doesn’t mean that you cannot have fulfillment and joy in the present moment.

The elderly and dying invariably regret what they didn’t do, not what they did.

## On future

> *"The greatest risk to a man is not that he aims too high and misses, but that he aims too low and hits."  
-- Michelangelo [1475]*

Dream big.

An ambitious goal sets the bar so high that even a failure can be considered a success by ordinary standards. If your dreams don’t frighten you, they are not big enough.

Our present (in)actions will compound into the future we will experience – that’s a great way to think about what lies ahead. However, don’t worry, you can’t control much.

Futurism is a study of time. Anomalies often represent the future but to our eyes they seem strange.

> *"The future belongs to those who see possibilities before they become obvious."

> *"The probability that your theory is correct decreases exponentially with the number of assumptions you make."  
-- Pedro Domingos [1965]*
