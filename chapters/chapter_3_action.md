# 3.1 - On preparing action

## On creativity, vision and ideas

<!--
> *'Invention, strictly speaking, is little more than a new combination of those images which have been previously gathered and deposited in the memory; nothing can come from nothing.' -- Sir Joshua Reynolds*
- (kk) Anything real begins with the fiction of what could be. Imagination is therefore the most potent force in the universe, and a skill you can get better at. It’s the one skill in life that benefits from ignoring what everyone else knows.
> *'Everything is hard before it is easy. The day before something is a breakthrough, it’s a stupid idea.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.' -- HN_dilemma*

We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. Creative minds are rarely tidy.

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

### How to find good ideas?

<!--
Changes in the environment unlock startup opportunities. startup ideas -> problems and trends
-->

Best ideas come from the market, not from you.

Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Creativity is a muscle, you have to practice it every day. Once it stays the same, it’s no longer creative. [Without new experiences, your soul rots](chapter_1_self.md#on-comfort-and-risk).

Ignorance is a blessing, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of.

> *'The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away.' -- Linus Pauling*

> *'If you accept conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives. Can you expect to be anything other than conventional?'*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.' -- Josh Waitzkin*

> *'The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.' -- Amos Tversky*

> *'The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.' -- Albert Einstein*

### How to judge ideas?

<!--
> *'A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

Peers are the best judging ideas. Managers will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

However the right idea not executed is worth nothing and a mediocre one well executed can prove to be worth much. Instead of focusing on ideas, focus on transforming yourself into the kind of person who can bring them to life. 

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There’s no market for them. There’s no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it’s a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else’s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

> *'Ideas, then good ideas, then execution, then Do-ing, then networking, then idea sex, then turning an idea into a future vision, then monetizing the idea. Then more ideas.' -- James Altucher*

## On analysis

<!--
- (kk) Rule of 7 in research. You can find out anything if you are willing to go seven levels. If the first source you ask doesn’t know, ask them who you should ask next, and so on down the line. If you are willing to go to the 7th source, you’ll almost always get your answer.
- (kk) Extraordinary claims should require extraordinary evidence to be believed.
- How can we overcome complexity bias? Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest solution or explanation is usually the correct one.
- best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- confirmaton bias, the mother of all bias. In truth, we all believe in things we can’t prove. If you’re intelligent, well-educated, and good at pulling facts, you’re going to be even better at confirming your own beliefs than someone who’s less intelligent or well-educated. Our brains are wired so that we make better lawyers than we do scientists, in that a lawyer will look for and use evidence to support their client, while ignoring and definitely not using evidence that does the opposite. We only want to watch television shows or read articles or listen to podcasts that confirm what we already believe -- what we already think we know.

Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it
We can be cautious of data which seems to immediately support our views.The desire to be right is the thirst for truth.
Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts.
This saves the time needed to make decisions, in particular when under pressure.

Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy. Yet contradicting information causes us to shy away, grasping for a reason to discard it.
> *'There are no facts, only interpretations.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*
> *'The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.' -- Gloria Steinem*
> *'Believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear.' --  Edgar Allan Poe*
-->

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Aaron Levenstein*

Analysis is an art, not a science.

The main problem with analysis is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered. Everyone is biased.

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'What Susie says of Sally says more about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Opinions are like a shirt: everyone should have at least a basic one, and it’s okay to really love yours, but try to remember to change it every now and again.'*

> *'We don't look at what we look, but at what we are.' -- Fernando Pessoa*

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*

> *'The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.' -- Robertson Davies*

Be specially careful with *confirmation bias*. Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas. 
Too much info is the main cause of it: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'I look for ways of changing my mind. I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side’s argument better than they do. ' -- Chalie Munger*

> *'What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'That’s the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions. Of course your first impulse is to ignore them' -- Paul Graham*

And when facing new ideas. Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

### Hints

> *'To understand is to know what to do.' -- Wittgenstein*
> *'A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.' -- Alfred Korzybski, Science and Sanity*

- E.g. if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.
- Any time you don't know, be clear that you don't know, but follow up with a plan for how you'll get the information and with a deadline for conveying that information. That is all the person asking the question really wants anyway: for you to supply the answer.
- tese antitheses -> syntesis
- reasoning by first principles and reasoning by analogy. correlations is not causation
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct.
- What’s your advantage: informational, analytical, or behavioral?	
- not playing your hand but playing your opponent.
- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.
- Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.
- Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
(under ideal conditions everybody is a genious)
- The most difficult subjects can be explained to the most slow-witted man if he has not formed any idea of them already; but the simplest thing cannot be made clear to the most intelligent man if he is firmly persuaded that he knows already, without a shadow of doubt, what is laid before him. Much of this is the result of our need for cognitive consistency. As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.
- You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- um texto é mais biased do que um gráfico onde cada um tira as suas comclusoes.
- As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths -- even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision -- are essentially manufactured.

## On planning

<!--
> *'If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.' -- Lewis Carroll*
- (kk) Always demand a deadline. A deadline weeds out the extraneous and the ordinary. It prevents you from trying to make it perfect, so you have to make it different. Different is better.

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.' -- Warren Buffett*

### How to plan? 

Start with a [vision](#on-creativity-vision-and-ideas). Then look for actionable steps.  

Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan. Plans are only a starting point.  
However too detailed plans (or too general plans) are not useful and a waste of time.

> *'Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.' -- Johnathan Swift*

> *'A strategy has a single, well defined focus. A strategy lays out a path to be followed. A strategy is made up of parts (tactics). Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus. A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally.' -- Geoffrey P. Chamberlain*

## On decision making

<!--
- (kk) Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
> *'My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower.'*
> *'It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago.' -- Derek Sivers*
> *'We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.'*
> *'Se não houvesse decisoes eramos todos bons/iguais.' -- António Simões*

- Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct.
- Think of mental models as minimum viable products. Sure, all of them can be improved. But the only way that can happen is if we try them out, educate ourselves and collectively refine them. Your kitchen knives are not as sharp as they could be. Does that matter as long as they still cut vegetables? Your bed is not as comfortable as it could be. Does that matter if you can still get a good night’s sleep in it? Your internet is not as fast as it could be. Does that matter as long as you can load this article? Arguably not.  A tool which maybe could be a bit sharper or easier to use, but still does the job.
- the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no ’skin in the game' should give estimates.
- With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.
- plan ahead plannin 20% action 80%?
- Beliefs lag behind reality. But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.
- Actions > Thoughts; Actions change the world. Not beliefs.
- i'm right -> how do i know i'm right. radical openmindedness -> stress test your ideas
- Idea-meritocratic decision-making is the best decision-making. The difference between an autocratic decision maker and a democratic decision maker.
- find 3 people that high expertise but that they discord and listen. take your conclusions
- The Problems With Goals: Goals have an endpoint. Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. Goals can make us complacent or reckless.

All models are wrong.

The practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful. This is what a mental model is – a functional tool. If you don't understand his limitations, you don't understand the model.

### How to speed up decisions?

<!--
- Jeff Bezos, once said in a letter to shareholders that he believes that optimal decisions occur when one has 70% of the necessary information. He went on to say that anything less than 70% and you’ll probably make a bad decision. But anything more than 70% and you’re probably wasting time on something that is unlikely to change the outcome.
-->

> *'The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action.' -- Daniel Gilber*

The ability to make fast decisions is a competitive advantage.

Some people get paralyzed by [over thinking](#on-starting-and-timing). When you don't decide somebody will decide for you.

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

> *'Economics teaches you that making a choice means giving up something.' -- Russ Roberts*

Hints:
 
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, we can make it fast and without perfect information. If a decision is irreversible, we had 
better slow down the decision-making process and ensure that we consider ample information and understand the problem as thoroughly as we can. (Jeff Bezos)
- 'Hell yes or no'. Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. (Derek Sivers)  
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer. (Warren Buffett)  
- Default to no. (Steve Jobs)

Forget All About Doing Good Work and Focus on Great Work
Good work, on the other hand, is an innocuous killer of greatness.
Good work is often what we use to fill our time and distract ourselves from great work we know we should be doing
Good work is that high-paying freelance project that distracts your focus from your new startup. Or that client you keep on retainer who doesn’t push your abilities or stretch you.

WORK THAT PRODUCES DIMINISHING (OR EVEN NEGATIVE) RETURNS
Imagine that you went outside and jogged for 10 minutes. This would be a healthy thing to do.
Now imagine you went outside and ran for 20 minutes. It’d also be healthy, but it wouldn’t necessarily be twice as healthy as the 10 minutes.
But she noticed that most of this extra time was pretty ineffective. The four hours at the end of the day, from say 6 PM to 10 PM, contributed about as much usable work as the first two hours of the day. People were essentially slaving away for marginal benefits.
And in worst case scenarios, people would start producing bad work or make bad decisions because they were so tired. And when you accumulate enough bad work and bad decisions, you actually unintentionally create more work for yourself. So you go from working for diminishing returns to working for negative returns.

If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value (think of a job: 20% of the employees do 80% of the work), then square that.
So now 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value.
So 4% of the work you do in life creates 64% of the benefits in your life.

But in order to build an awesome career doing hard but satisfying long-term work, you need to build your ability to focus for hours at a time. You need to learn hard skills. You need to let go of multitasking, distraction, and the temptation to be “busy.

The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were:
- Start with the answer first.
- Group and summarize your supporting arguments.
- Logically order your supporting ideas.

Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”

The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present 3 reasons. Not 2, not 4, but exactly 3.
“There are 3 reasons why we should do this” and then proceed to list my reasons in almost a numbered bullet point format (“First…”, “Second…”, and “Last…”).

- I observed that The Rule of 3 was actually pretty effective in persuading clients to take action. Why? Three reasons:
	- Your argument gets their attention and is memorable
	- You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons
	- You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.
- The non-linearity of productivity
- never mistake action for motion
- there is no right time! its a delusion
- Have a Mission. Every day, whether it’s “be creative today.” Or “go some place you’ve never been” or “talk to ten random strangers”, make a mission. Learn something new. Missions are for people who DO. Mission statements are for people who DON’T.
- Nothing happens in the world because of thought. Or because of talking. Or because of writing. It happens because of DO-ing.
- Knowing is half the battle, the other half is action implementing that knowledge to your own advantage.
- Time is the most precious thing you own.
- lei dos 50%, so qd os lucros sao maiores q os prejuizos é q uma coisa é feita e vence-se a procrastination
- add mark manson on procrastination - We feel anxiety over a deadline or a task that we don’t want to do, even though we know we should. So we procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety.
- Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.
- If you are unsure of a course of action, do not attempt it. Your doubts and hesitations will infect your execution.

### Why people procrastinate?

<!--
> *'It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

- [Perfectionism](chapter_1_self.md#on-perfectionism). You fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all.  
- Fear (of change). Procrastination is deeply tied to anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us.  
- Lack of urgency / deadlines (the panic monster). Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused. What gets measured gets done. 
- No inspiration. The inspiration you are waiting for, in order to start, is on the other side of starting. Momentum generates motivation. Inspiration is for amateurs.
- No opportunities. When hope disappears, so does action.
- No preparation. You can learn while you do it.  

> *'One of the counterintuitive things that I've learned is that procrastination is often a side-effect of perfectionism.' -- bane_HN*

> *'The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.' -- Manson’s Law of Avoidance*

> *'Go and do the things you can’t. That is how you get to do them.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.' -- Milton Berle*

Timing is important but don't wait for the [perfect occasion](), a good occasion is a safer bet. You will languish if you stop for a long time. Paralysis is worse than bad timing.

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER, have a [plan](#on-planning-and-decision-making). Any plan will do.

## On speed, position and direction

<!--
> *'Don’t worry how or where you begin. As long as you keep moving, your success will be far from where you start.' -- Kevin Kelly*

15. Waiting may be the best course of action. A fountain gets muddy with but little stirring up, and does not get clear by our meddling with it but by our leaving it alone. -- Balthasar Gracian

7. Be patient. You must pass through the circumference of time before arriving at the centre of opportunity. A wise reserve seasons the aims and matures the means. Time’s crutch effects more than the iron club of Hercules. God Himself chasteneth not with a rod but with time. He spake a great word who said, “Time and I against any two.” Fortune herself rewards waiting with the first prize. -- Balthasar Gracian

Velocity and speed are different things. Speed is the distance traveled over time. I can run around in circles with a lot of speed and cover several miles that way, but I’m not getting anywhere. Velocity measures displacement. It’s direction-aware.

Here are three ways you can increase your velocity:

- To the extent possible, ruthlessly shave away the unnecessary tasks, priorities, meetings, and BS. Put all your effort into the projects that really matter.
- Don’t rely on your willpower to say no; instead, create systems that help you fend off distractions.example: One of my management principles was “no meeting mornings.”
- say “no” to your boss.

## On focus, priorities and productivity

<!--
- 80/20 is fractal!

Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn’t forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things?
Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all. -- tim ferriss
4) Focus On Effort, Not Outcome
What’s that have to do with productivity? Plenty. Because you worry about all kinds of stuff that you can’t do anything about. And that’s wasted time and energy.
And neuroscience research shows that by focusing on what you have control over, you decrease stress.
You can’t control whether it ends up as a “robbery” or an “attempted robbery”, just focus on executing the heist in a way that would make mom proud.

- “Occam’s Razor” says the simplest answer is often the best. So start ruthlessly cutting all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish TPS report” might turn into “write TPS report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- there are only three ways in which you can increase productivity: Increase the physical, mental, and emotional energy you have available for each task. Doing more of the right things and fewer unnecessary things. Improve the systems that you use to complete a given task or project. In other words, the three paths to productivity are: Energy - Effectiveness - Efficiency: productivity is about understanding your constraints. getting the right things done
- “Instead of asking how many tasks you can tackle given your working hours,” writes Morten Hansen in Great at Work, “ask how many you can ditch given what you must do to excel.” I did what I needed to do to keep my job. As John Stuart Mill said, “as few as you can, as many as you must.”
- Busy is a decision. What you are really saying: is not a priority. Is a excuse for not doing something we don't feel like doing.
- Focus on adaptability not effectiveness
- Schedule less time for important tasks. Be mindful of how you spend your time.
- Set yourself deadlines.
- complete at least 1 important but not urgent task per day.

### Productivity hints

<!--
- “If you want a task done quickly, ask a busy person to do it.”
- work is a queue of queues. trying hard is not the key to success. this not mean that you don't put your best effort.
-->

> *'Don't make 100 decisions when one will do.' -- Peter Drucker*

> *'My life is better when I’m spontaneous after I’ve done my most important thing. Being spontaneous before that, that’s where it becomes a distraction and does me harm.' -- Gary Keller*

Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity: it’s stupidity. Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. Productivity is about attention management.

Do less to achieve more. You don't need to optimise everything.  
20% of your effort will give you 80% of output: it may be enough or even more than enough.

- Focus on 3 outcomes (not todos) per day and tackle the most important one in the morning.
- Set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-based goals. Always work with a specific purpose in mind.
- Be fully present: learn to focus on what you are doing now.
- Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place. Tackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage lies. Focus on doing the right things instead of doing things right.  
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk, Too many options may paralize you: remove them.
- When a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it—don’t add it to your to-do list or capture it for later.
- Protect your hours of real work. Separate “real hours” with breaks. Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Buy yourself time: delegate. Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- Work by layers: from functional to excellency.

Control what you can: [what you’re primed by](introduction.md#the-real-you), [who you are around](chapter_2_groups.md#on-family-and-friends), the ideas and problems you [focus](#on-focus-priorities-and-productivity) on. Ignore the rest.

Consuming information gives the control freak an illusion of control. He doesn't want to acknowledge that the universe doesn't make sense and he doesn't trust himself to handle disorder in a situation that will get out of his league or skillset.

I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]

I look forward to your response. [Power close.]

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]

I appreciate the consideration and the offer.

I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]

Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]

I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.)
Never make the first offer.
Thank them.
Set the tone for the negotiation.
Display social proof/market validation.
Set your “ask.”
Help them visualize the win.
Reiterate interest and close strong.

- First establish a baseline — use Google.
Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?”
“Will you do that -10%?”
“If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?”
“If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?”
“What if I pay cash?”
“Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.”
WALK AWAY.

I said, “$2000”. She said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”
I said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”
She liked that so much she came up with the $1500. -- Derek Sivers

- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like:
What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.

- Call all owners to rent. 8 said yes. Then auction! 2200 -> 1500.

We're all in sales. To sell is to deal with objections.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it’s mostly [applied persuasion](chapter_3_action.md#on-charming) and keeping [relationships](#on-relationships). Best sellers are now ambiverts.

Traditional selling: hunters (extroverts)

- Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
- Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
- Persisting (to push until you make the sale)  

Modern selling: farmers (ambiverts and introverts)

- Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the Web, reading and analyzing information)  
- Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
- Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

### On negotiation

<!--
it's easy to negotiate with integrous people.
-->

> *'You don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.'*

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).  
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are giving more/less value than receiving for it.

- «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- Never negotiate with binary questions: '«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'  
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'
- If you want to go fast, let the other part go first.

To negotiate is to have options. Hints:

- The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.  
- When people feel they have a choice, they walk into your trap that much more easily.
- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating. The analytical cold guy is very patient. The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast. For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important.
- On negotiation you don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.
- Mirroring and reword. repeating the last one to three words of the other person. It opens up people’s brain. Its' very effective. Test the firmness of what they want. People didn't even realize it.
- Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'Flattery is the infantry of negotiation.' -- Lord Chandos*

> *'People may or may not say what they mean,” he explained, “but they always say something designed to get what they want.' -- David Mamet*

> *'Marketers don’t convince. Engineers convince. Marketers persuade. Persuasion appeals to the emotions and to fear and to the imagination. Convincing requires a spreadsheet or some other rational device.' -- Seth Godin*

However always strive to achieve a win-win situation. The deal will fall if both sides don't take what they need from it. The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.

> *'Don’t follow your mentors; follow your mentors’ mentors.' -- David Leach*

> *'Follow the thought leaders instead of the traffic leaders.'*

> *'Your father is your first mentor.'*

You should be a mentor yourself. Be [generous](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-rewards-and-generosity) and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

### How to mentor your kids?

<!--
> *'Be nice to your children because they are going to choose your nursing home.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.' -- Kevin Kelly*
> *'When a child asks an endless string of “why?” questions, the smartest reply is, “I don’t know, what do you think?”' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

> *'My advice is my autobiography not slogans. People relate better like that.' -- James Altucher*

> *'If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.' -- Albert Einstein*

Don't tell your kids them how to live. Live fully and let them see. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar.

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know what is that for you and why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).  
- Fight perfectionism: «If you get a C or lower, I’ll buy you a present. If you score higher than that, I won’t buy you anything, because you won’t need it.»  
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure.  
- Optimism: «You have the gift of today.»

However some people are not ready to accept your vision. And «givers» attract «takers»: remember that you [don't owe them](#on-freedom) anything.

## On generosity and incentives

<!--
- (kk) Optimize your generosity. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.
- power of incentives: Ignoring incentives almost never works out well. Psychologists argue that the best way for us to learn complex behaviors is via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. continuous reinforcement |> intermitent reinforcement
- Generosity without Expectation is Sexy. It means that your thoughts, words, and actions are all in congruence. you don’t live a life that is incongruent with what you want to make others happy. You live a life of congruence where everything is in line. This is the pathway to true power. Be generous from a place of abundance, where you are giving because you are already so full, not from a place of scarcity where you are kind because you want something in return.
- The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your time, presence and attention.
-->

> *'No one has ever become poor by giving.' -- Anne Frank*

> *'He that gives should never remember and he that receives should never forget.' -- Talmud*

Always be generous. A low value gift can have the opposite effect.

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'* 

> *'The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he'd learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I'll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn't be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people’s talents. He'd hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn't want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there.' -- HN_danielvf*

> *'My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn't lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human.' -- HN_danielvf*

### On punishments

Extintion of rewards is more effective.

Punishment only works near the situation that cause it, triggers a fight-or-flight response and renders people aggressive and inhibits the ability to learn new and better responses.

People are amazing optimizers and will find any loopholes or gaps to their advantage. No one will help you in a way that is prejudicial to them.

> *'Don’t fight a starving animal. Never contend with a man who has nothing to Lose; for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict.

2. Make others dependent on you: hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one. More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy. -- Balthasar Gracian

- The metagame is playing a different game than your competitors. A game they can't play. The metagame is this psychological game that exists among players, involving adjustments – adjustments based on how an opponent is likely to interpret a given set of actions. Better players adjust their strategies and styles to those of particular opponents, always analyzing how the opponents are playing in terms of how the opponents believe they're playing.
Maintaining a well-balanced strategy, while deciphering your opponents' strategies, is the key to the metagame. If you comprehend the concept of the metagame, accurately perceive the flow of your table and then tournament, and stay alerted to and aware of current strategy trends, you'll be able to successfully mix up your play when considering your image and that of your opponents. In return, your game will be highly unpredictable and difficult to read, which should be your ultimate goal. Part of their greatness comes from identifying the constraints of others and capitalizing on those structural disadvantages.
In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.

According to Rumelt, a strategy must include “premeditation, the anticipation of others’ behavior, and the purposeful design of coordinated actions. As a general rule, strategy is more important in situations where other parties have the potential to thwart or disrupt actions, or where our plans are at risk if we don’t take meaningful steps to achieve them. Good strategy requires us to both focus on a goal, and anticipate obstacles to reaching that goal.  When we encounter obstacles, we may need to employ what Freedman calls “deceits, ruses, feints, manoeuvres and a quicker wit”—our tactics.
-->

> *'Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.' -- Napoleon*

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.  
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

Strategy is about winning before the battle begins, while tactics are about striking at weakness.

> *'The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed.' --  Richard Rumelt*

Some hints:

- Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.  
- If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.  
- Beware of counter-attacking: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.  
- Divide and conquer.

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

> *'Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.

## On charming

<!--
> *'To combat an adversary, become their friend.' -- Kevin Kelly*

- All in all, just keep it simple. Don’t try to complicate the situation. Focus on being yourself, enjoying yourself. If you’re not having a good time, chances are good that people around you aren’t either. Charm is not about trying to pile on a bunch of techniques or manipulating people. It’s actually the complete opposite: letting human nature do its thing.

“It’s easy,” he said. “Just make them contradictions.”
To be human is to be a contradiction

- People’s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.

## On mirroring

<!--
> *'Don’t treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.' -- Kevin Kelly*

reciprocation bias
The archaeologist Richard Leakey believes reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: “We are human because our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation.
social sanctions can be tough on those who fail to cooperate
As with most things, however, reciprocation has a darker side. Just as we tend to reciprocate good behavior, sometimes we also pay back bad deeds. One of the most effective game-theory strategies is tit for tat.
The standard antidote to one’s overactive hostility is to train oneself to defer reaction.
There’s also another way. Because the reciprocation tendency is so extreme, we can reverse the course of events by doing good rather than harm to the other party.
We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.
Cialdini moved from rejection to compliance after the boy had moved from a larger to a smaller request.  The remarkable thing, and this is where bias comes in, was that Cialdini was not at all interested in either of the things the boy had offered.

## On winning

<!--
> *'You don't win by predicting the future; you win by getting the odds right.' -- Will Bonner

- quem ganha a maioria dos duelos normalmente ganha o jogo. micro e o macro -- sergio conceição
- tecnically win or fundamentally win
- winning by exhaustion: Traditional military theorists such as Sun Tzu (“Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting”) and Machiavelli (“Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception”) evangelized for clever tactics. These methods tend to result in far fewer casualties, waste fewer resources and are a display of superior intellect, rather than just strength. Attrition warfare is usually a last resort only. And most of the time when you win, it’s only temporary. By not scoring a decisive blow, the winners leave room for the losers to believe they can win the next time. From the start, the Battle of Verdun was fought upon a foundation of attrition. Both sides were essentially trapped, with no option but to keep trying to force the other into submission. Both sides were using similar approaches with similar capabilities. The concept of attrition applies outside of war. Bureaucracies grind people out. Excessive competition among businesses might be good for consumers, but it’s a grind for the companies involved. History shows that the way out of trench warfare is the use of asymmetric weaponry. If you’re using basically the same strategy with basically the same resources as your competitor, you’re in a war of attrition.

- When I want someone to choose me, when I want an event to be different, when I want a life circumstance to change, I can only surrender to it. I can’t control it. Surrender is ACTIVE. It teams you up with the strongest part of yourself. Surrender is PEACEFUL. It lets anxiety take a break. “Anxiety, stop trying to control”.

In order to come back you have to go away.

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. If you didn’t quit anything you woud be still playing with toddlers. Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning. Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.

## On forgiveness and revenge

<!--
> *'If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn’t part of ourselves doesn’t disturb us.' -- Hermann Hesse*

> *'The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive.' -- John Green*

> *'An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

If forgiveness is a process of release then the opposite of forgiveness is a decision to hold onto something.

Many people think that the alternative to forgiveness is punishment: either choose to forgive someone for what they’ve done, or we return the favor with some sort of retribution. But punishment isn’t really the opposite of forgiveness. After all, we can punish someone without forgiving them, or punish them in order to forgive them. By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.
