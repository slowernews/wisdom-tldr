# 3.1 - On preparing action

## On creativity

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

Creative minds are rarely tidy. We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. 

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

### How to find good ideas?

> *'Using creativity to solve problems cannot be taught, and it's ultimately what free markets pay for.' -- Naval Ravikant*

> *'Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away.' -- Linus Pauling*

Best ideas come from the market, not from you. Changes in the environment unlock opportunities.

Creativity is a muscle. [Without new experiences](chapter_1_self.md#on-comfort-and-risk), it atroffiates. Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Ignorance is a blessing, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives lead to conventional ideas.

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.' -- Josh Waitzkin*

> *'The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.' -- Amos Tversky*

> *'The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.' -- Albert Einstein*

### How to judge ideas?

Peers are the best judging ideas. Managers will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

However the right idea not executed is worth nothing and a mediocre one well executed can be worth much. Instead of focusing on ideas, focus on transforming yourself into the kind of person who can bring them to life. 

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There’s no market for them. There’s no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it’s a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else’s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

> *'Ideas, then good ideas, then execution, then Do-ing, then networking, then idea sex, then turning an idea into a future vision, then monetizing the idea. Then more ideas.' -- James Altucher*

> *'Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.' -- HN_dilemma*

## On analysis

<!--
- How can we overcome complexity bias? Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest solution or explanation is usually the correct one.
- confirmaton bias, the mother of all bias. In truth, we all believe in things we can’t prove. If you’re intelligent, well-educated, and good at pulling facts, you’re going to be even better at confirming your own beliefs than someone who’s less intelligent or well-educated. Our brains are wired so that we make better lawyers than we do scientists, in that a lawyer will look for and use evidence to support their client, while ignoring and definitely not using evidence that does the opposite. We only want to watch television shows or read articles or listen to podcasts that confirm what we already believe -- what we already think we know. best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it. Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts. Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy.

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'There are no facts, only interpretations.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Aaron Levenstein*

Analysis is an art, not a science.

The main problem with analysis is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered. Everyone is biased.

> *'Believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear.' -- Edgar Allan Poe*

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'What Susie says of Sally says more about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Opinions are like a shirt: everyone should have at least a basic one, and it’s okay to really love yours, but try to remember to change it every now and again.'*

> *'We don't look at what we look, but at what we are.' -- Fernando Pessoa*

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*

> *'The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.' -- Robertson Davies*

Be specially careful with *confirmation bias*. Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas. 
Too much info is the main cause of it: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.' -- Gloria Steinem*

> *'I look for ways of changing my mind. I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side’s argument better than they do. ' -- Chalie Munger*

> *'What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'That’s the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions. Of course your first impulse is to ignore them' -- Paul Graham*

And when facing new ideas. Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

> *'The truth is rarely pure and never simple.' -- Oscar Wilde*

### Hints

<!--
> *'To understand is to know what to do.' -- Wittgenstein*
> *'We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.'*

- if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.
- tese antitheses -> syntesis
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct. You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- What’s your advantage: informational, analytical, or behavioral?	
- not playing your hand but playing your opponent.
- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.
- Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.
- Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
- As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.
- As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths -- even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision -- are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth.

- Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.  
- «Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.  
- We always think that the people who agree with us are really smart.  
- Skepticism is a great servant and a terrible master.  
- Randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.  
- There’s always a good reason and a real reason.
- There's truth on *group* stereotypes. *Group* opinions self correct themselves.
- Prefer stats than narratives.

> *'Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.' -- Sigmund Freud*

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That’s where the gold mine is: «It doesn’t make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden. Don’t try to make sense of the world. It’s too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'  
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (paraphrased)*

> *'The most valuable insights are both general and surprising. Ordinarily, the best that people can do is one without the other: either surprising without being general (e.g. gossip), or general without being surprising (e.g. cliches).' -- Paul Graham*

> *'I conceive that the great part of the miseries of mankind are brought upon them by false estimates they have made of the value of things.' -- Benjamin Franklin*

## On planning and strategy

> *'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.' -- Kevin Kelly*

You can’t predict but you can prepare for the highly probable scenarios.

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'He who fails to plan is planning to fail.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Hope is not a strategy.' -- Vince Lombardi*

> *'If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.' -- Lewis Carroll*

> *'The movie might be good or bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.' -- unknown*

> *'Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.' -- Warren Buffett*

### How to plan? 

Start with a [vision](#on-creativity-and-ideas). Then look for actionable steps.  

Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan. Plans are only a starting point.  
However too detailed plans (or too general plans) are not useful and a waste of time.

> *'Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.' -- Johnathan Swift*

> *'A strategy has a single, well defined focus. A strategy lays out a path to be followed. A strategy is made up of parts (tactics). Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus. A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally.' -- Geoffrey P. Chamberlain*

> *'Strategy requires thought; tactics require observation.' -- Max Euwe*

> *'I always worked until I had something done and I always stopped when I knew what was going to happen next. That way I could be sure of going on the next day.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'You make plans and god laughs.' -- Yiddish proverbs*

> *'Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.' -- Mike Tyson*

Don't sabotage them when they get tedious or too difficult.

## On decision making

<!--
- (kk) Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
> *'My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower.'*
- Wait 48 hours before buying stuff
> *'It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago.' -- Derek Sivers*
> *'Se não houvesse decisoes eramos todos iguais.' -- António Simões*

- Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct.
- the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no ’skin in the game' should give estimates.
- With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.
- Beliefs lag behind reality. But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.
- Actions > Thoughts; Actions change the world. Not beliefs.
- find 3 people that high expertise but that they discord and listen. take your conclusions
- The Problems With Goals: Goals have an endpoint. Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. Goals can make us complacent or reckless.
- Blue collar want to feel the same as others. White collar want to feel different from others.
- decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
- Your product is decisions. 
- clear thinkers take feedback from reality, not society. -- Naval Ravikant*
- the three big decisions: where you live, who you're with and what you're doing. -- Naval Ravikant*
- in the age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill. -- Naval Ravikant*
- thinking is difficult. that's why most people judge. -- carl jung
- the heart decides. the head rationalizes. -- Naval Ravikant*
- decision making is everything. if you get 80% right is exponnetially better than 70% right.
- claer thinkers take feedback from reality not society. -- Naval Ravikant*
- clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity. -- Naval Ravikant*
- the only part you can't outsource is judgement. -- Naval Ravikant*
- you know you're good at something when you switch from making decisionswith your conscious mind to making decisions with your instincts. -- Naval Ravikant*

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears.' -- Nelson Mandela*

You are evaluated by your decisions.

We think we make choices but our choices are influenced by others. People pick what is familiar.

> *'All models are wrong but some are useful.' -- George Box*

> *'A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one.' -- Joan Robinson*

All models are wrong. The practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful. This is what a mental model is – a functional tool. If you don't understand its limitations, you don't understand the model.

> *'A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.' -- Alfred Korzybski*

> *'Scientists generally agree that no theory is one hundred percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science.' -- Yuval Noah Harari*

> *'The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that «right» and «wrong» are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.' -- Isaac Asimov*

### How to speed up decisions?

> *'The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action.' -- Daniel Gilber*

To make fast decisions is a competitive advantage.

Most people get paralyzed by over thinking. If you don't decide timely somebody will do it for you.

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

> *'Economics teaches you that making a choice means giving up something.' -- Russ Roberts*

Hints:
 
- Default to no. (Steve Jobs)
- 'Hell yes or no'. Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. (Derek Sivers)  
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer. (Warren Buffett)  
- With two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the sort term. Pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality. (Naval Ravikant)
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, make it fast and without perfect information. If is irreversible, slow down and ensure that you understand the problem. (Jeff Bezos)
- Choose the one that may produce most serendipity down the line.
- Optimal decisions occur with 70% of the information. Anything less and you’ll probably make a bad decision. Anything more and you’re probably wasting time on something that is unlikely to change the outcome. (Jeff Bezos)

## On communication

> *'People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk.' -- Chuck Palahniuk*

Speak less and listen more. Listening is powerful.

> *'Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens.' -- Jimi Hendrix*

> *'When you listen, you may learn something new.' -- Dalai Lama*

### How to communicate? 

<!--
- be autentic offer good energy, be human, build rapport, listen, humbleness, genuine appreciation. How to make a good first impression: putting your best foot forward actually reveals the real you.
- Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day. The point is to move what’s exciting you to the top of your mental list so you’re ready to go if an opportunity presents.
- admit when you're wrong. shut up when you're right -- john gottman
- people believe everything, if you whisper it.
- the best way to get someone's attention is to stop giving them yours.
- smart people talking to other smart people tend to have vety short conversations. -- Naval Ravikant*
- the secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone. -- Naval Ravikant*
- a performer shouldn't look at the audience
- a loucura é a incapacidade de comunicar-se
- with truly logical people, most arguments are very short and based mainly on differing assumptions. -- Naval Ravikant*
-->

- Smile and relax. Stop trying to impress. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people smile more than other people. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Learn how to lessen the crushing pressure of being interesting by focusing on being interested: controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and it will appear as fake.
- Listen. Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Don’t worry about what you’re going to say next. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. Be interested to be interesting, Want to be the most interesting person in the room? Learn the art of active listening. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..  
	- Mirroring: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question. (Yes, it’s that simple.)
	- Paraphrasing: Repeat what they just said in your own words.
	- Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.
- Get better at asking questions, they are more important than answers. But you must be curious, asking questions without paying attention is worthless. Making good/unusual questions will make people interested in you. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It’s hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Be interested to be interesting.
- Banish meaningless small talk and learn how to ask questions that build rapport and natural conversation. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Build rapport, cut the BS. Speak what’s in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best way to be highly influential is to be human to everyone you meet. Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but crucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments or asking for advice.
- Don’t be stubborn: you don’t always have to get the last word. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don’t judge. Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. No one is inherently boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions.

> *'Don’t be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.' -- Kevin Kelly*

### How to tell good stories?

Good stories condense a massive amount of details into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment. When it is accurate, it’s only accurate to the extent that the story requires in order to remain relevant.

> *'Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out.' -- Alfred Hitchcock*

> *'The more you say, the less people remember.' -- François Fénelon*

### How to discord?

Listen as you’re wrong.

Ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. If they can explain why they are correct, you'll learn something. If they can't you'll soften their views.

- «Will you tell me your story? I’d love to know how you came to this point of view. It sounds like I could learn something.»  

> *'Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference.' -- Mark Twain*

### On public speaking

You don't need to answer their questions.

- You can say whatever you want if it's interesting.
- Know when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions.
- Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of desagreeing.

> *'Always say less than necessary.' -- Kevin Kelly*

# 3.2 - On executing

## On starting and timing

<!--
- you always throw out your first pancake - primeiro milho é para os pardais
- Enter action with boldness. Play the ball before it plays you. Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.
- Research is not doing something. Knowledge is never the issue, action is.

- Be useful, not important.
- monk mode -> no communication during mornings, only deep work -> meetings afternoon
- If something compounds at 1% a day, it will be 37 times better in a year. If something loses 1% a day, it will be 0.03% of what it was in a year. I know it’s hard to quantify. It’s impossible. But the direction is what is important. It will all shake out in the end. This is the path to improvement any area of life.
- jogar c o baralho todo / jogar com um subset
- keep earning your title, or it expires. -- derek sivers
- The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were: Start with the answer first. Group and summarize your supporting arguments. Logically order your supporting ideas. Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”
- The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present _exactly_3 reasons: Your argument gets their attention and is memorable. You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons. You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.

- [Perfectionism](chapter_1_self.md#on-perfectionism). You fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all.  
- Anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us. We procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety.
- No hope. When hope disappears, so does action.

### How to defeat procrastination?

Don't wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet. You will languish if you stop for a long time. Paralysis is worse than bad timing.

At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused (the panic monster). What gets measured gets done. 

> *'The best thing you can do is the right thing, the second best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER, never mistake action for motion. You must think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought. So make a plan. Any plan will do.

> *'A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.' -- General George Patton*

> *'No one ever wrote a plan to be fat, lazy or stupid. That’s what happens when you don’t have a plan.' – Larry Winget*

## On speed and direction

> *'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

> *'Start as close to the end as possible.' -- Kurt Vonnegu*

> *'Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.' -- Bill Gates*

Direction is more important than velocity. Even if we can't choose the starting point, often, we can choose the direction.

When possible, position yourself for victory by bringing the target closer. Location is better than space amount so trade space for time.

> *'Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success.'*

Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.

> *'Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.' -- John Tukey*

> *'No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.' -- Warren Buffett*

## On focus, priorities and productivity

<!--
- Protect your time like your money. Strategic laziness as a leverage point.
- maker days and manager days
- start ruthlessly cutting all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish report” might turn into “write report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- As John Stuart Mill said, “as few as you can, as many as you must.”
- Busy is a decision. What you are really saying: is not a priority. Is a excuse for not doing something we don't feel like doing.
- Focus on adaptability not effectiveness
- Schedule less time for important tasks. Be mindful of how you spend your time.
- Set yourself deadlines.
- complete at least 1 important but not urgent task per day.
- Media companies harvest your attention and transform it into revenue.
- If you’re not turning off part of your audience, then you’re not going to be fascinating,” she says; “you’re not going to be memorable.'*	
try to hit 10% of your followers instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time.

> *'A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner.' -- Seth Godin* 

> *'People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying «no» to 1000 things.' -- Steve Jobs*

First the essential. Then the details.

Focusing is an art. Time itself is not your limitation: attention is.  
Busy imply out of control. Lack of time is lack of priorities.

> *'Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all.' -- Tim Ferriss*

> *'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (42nd law of power)*

> *'You can do anything, but not everything.' -- David Allen*

> *'When everything is a priority nothing is a priority. Attempting to maximize competing variables is a recipe for disaster. Picking one variable, and relentlessly focusing on it, which is an effective strategy, diverges from the norm. It’s hard to compete with businesses who have correctly identified the right variables to maximize or minimize.' -- Charlie Munger*

### On productivity

<!--
- work is a queue of queues. trying hard is not the key to success. this not mean that you don't put your best effort.
-->

> *'Don't make 100 decisions when one will do.' -- Peter Drucker*

> *'My life is better when I’m spontaneous after I’ve done my most important thing. Being spontaneous before that, that’s where it becomes a distraction and does me harm.' -- Gary Keller*

> *'The price of productivity is creativity.' -- Naval Ravikant*

Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity: it’s stupidity.

Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. Productivity is about attention management. Do less to achieve more. You don't need to optimise everything. 20% of your effort will give you 80% of output: it may be enough or even more than enough. 

Hints:

- 80/20 is fractal: If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value. So now 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value. So 4% of the work you do in life may create 64% of the benefits in your life.
- Focus on 3 outcomes (not todos) per day and tackle the most important one in the morning.
- Set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-based goals. Always work with a specific purpose in mind.
- Be fully present: learn to focus on what you are doing now.
- Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place. Tackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage lies. Focus on doing the right things instead of doing things right.  
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk, Too many options may paralize you: remove them.
- When a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it—don’t add it to your to-do list or capture it for later.
- Protect your hours of real work. Separate “real hours” with breaks. Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Buy yourself time: delegate. Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- Work by layers: from functional to excellency.
- If you want a task done quickly, ask a busy person to do it.

## On control

<!--
- Não se pode fazer colecção de tudo.
- focus on what doesnt change
- we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe. 
-->

> *'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.' -- unknown* 

Disorder is not a mistake; it’s our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

Control what you can: [what you’re primed by](introduction.md#the-real-you), [who you are around](chapter_2_groups.md#on-family-and-friends), the ideas and problems you [focus](#on-focus-priorities-and-productivity) on. Ignore the rest.

Consuming information gives the control freak an illusion of control. He doesn't want to acknowledge that the universe doesn't make sense and he doesn't trust himself to handle disorder in a situation that will get out of his league or skillset.

> *'If things seem under control, you’re just not going fast enough.' -- Mario Andretti (F1 pilot)*

> *'One’s real life is often the life that one does not lead.' -- Oscar Wilde*

> *'If you change the way you look at things, the thing you look at change' -- Dr. Wayne Dyer*

## On balance

<!--
- alguem mais loose q tu é um maluco, mais tight é um nhónhó. somos a medida de tudo
- There are two approaches to improving yourself: 1) The self-improvement junkie. 2) The self-improvement tourists. MM
-->

> *'Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.' -- Albert Einstein*

Life is a balancing act. Most things are not binary.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite. The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It’s about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships and personal growth.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.' -- unknown*

### How to balance an imbalance?

Overcompensate. Some people get passion from something they struggled with.

## On change and adapting

<!--
- Inertia is why a car does not stop the moment the brakes are applied.
> *'You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain.' -- Harvey Dent in The Dark Knight*
-->

> *'However beautiful the strategy, you should occasionally look at the results.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'At Berkshire there has never been a master plan. Anyone who wanted to do it, we fired because it takes on a life of its own and doesn’t cover new reality. We want people taking into account new information' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'Life is more like tetris than chess.' -- Tor Blair*

Plans are not static.

Switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go. If problems shift faster than your rate of adaptation you loose.

> *'I am a man of fixed and unbending principles, the first of which is to be flexible at all times.' -- Everett Dirksen*

> *'The most important thing to do if you find yourself in a hole is to stop digging.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'The directions to get you anywhere include a few turns:  
Sometimes you need to say YES to everything and be open to growth;  
Sometimes you need to say NO to everything and focus.  
It’s scary to make those direction choices but fear is a great road sign.'  
-- Derek Sivers (paraphrased)*

> *'What got you here won't get you there.' -- Marshall Goldsmith*

> *'Whatever space and time mean, place and occasion mean more.' -- Aldo van Eyck*

Listen to predict a collapse.

> *'When things break, it’s not the actual breaking that prevents them from getting back together again. It’s because a little piece gets lost - the two remaining ends couldn't fit together even if they wanted to. The whole shape has changed.' -- John Green*

Adapt instead of reacting. An opportunity is taking an unwanted job.

> *'When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'If I don’t have red, I use blue.' -- Pablo Picasso*

### How to change?

> *'It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek.' -- Kevin Kelly*

There are limits on change. Willpower is finite and change requires attention. However, small changes in a complex system can cause large changes. 

> *'Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once.' -- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

> *'The reasonable man adapts himself to the world: the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.' -- George Bernard Shaw*

## On getting advantage

<!--
> *'All guns are loaded.' -- Kevin Kelly*

- What works at a small scale (say, a Utopian community), loses its effectiveness as it scales. Everything has a breakpoint.
Their cheating had a small individual effect initially, so it went unnoticed. But the follow-on effect to individual cheating is group cheating, and the utopian goal of To each according to his need, from each according to his ability had the effect of expanding everyone’s needs and shrinking their ability, aided by envy and reciprocation effects.
- Finding cassandras to stop catastrophes. The “Cassandras” are experts in their field. These people are data driven.

> *'Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
An army of robots is freely available - it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.' -- Naval Ravikant* 

> *'Make others dependent on you: hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one. More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

- In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.
-->

> *'Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.' -- Archimedes*

> *'Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.' -- Napoleon*

Leverage is a force multiplier.

Imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.  
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

Strategy is about winning before the battle begins, while tactics are about striking at weakness.

> *'The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed.' -- Richard Rumelt*

Hints:

- Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.  
- If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.  
- Beware of counter-attacking: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.  
- In essence, for a change to occur, you must apply more energy to the system than is extracted by the system.  
- Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex, habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.  
- Divide and conquer.

### On unpredictability

<!--
- All in all, just keep it simple. Don’t try to complicate the situation. Focus on being yourself, enjoying yourself. If you’re not having a good time, chances are good that people around you aren’t either. Charm is not about trying to pile on a bunch of techniques or manipulating people. It’s actually the complete opposite: letting human nature do its thing.
- Bad liars should speak as little as possible.
- if somebody asks for the evidence, normally, he’s lieing
- the good reason and the real reason.
-->

> *'We catch more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

> *'Use selective honesty and generosity to disarm your victim.'  
'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'  
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'  
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd laws of power)*

- People’s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.  
- To persuade up, focus on interests; to persuade down focus on emotions.  
- Use absence and bait to attract people. However use absence with moderation or soon you'll not be needed.It will become a challenge for them to win your affections. The ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.  
- Instead of killing, charm the snake to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. First they have to trust you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy has always to prove himself.

If we play by the rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish. Clean players on shady markets usually don't do well on the long term.

By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.

### On mirroring

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*

Reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation. We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

> *'It only hurts when you don’t have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk*

> *'Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.' -- Paulo Coelho*

In order to come back you have to go away.

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. If you didn’t quit anything you would be still playing with toddlers. Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning. Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.

## On forgiveness and revenge

<!--
> *'To heal a wound you must stop scratching it.' -- Paulo Coelho*
people who forgive easily are taken for granted
-->

> *'The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive.' -- John Green*

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.

Forgiveness is a process of release so the opposite is a decision to hold onto something. By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.
