# 3.1 - On preparing action

## On creativity, vision and ideas

> *'The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing.' -- HN_dilemma*

We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. Creative minds are rarely tidy.

> *'Good artists copy; great artists steal.' -- Steve Jobs & others*

> *'Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing.' -- Salvador Dali*

> *'The new is the forgotten because everything has already happened.' -- Arturo Pérez Reverte*

> *'To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk.' -- Thomas Edison*

### How to find good ideas?

Best ideas come from the market, not from you. Changes in the environment unlock opportunities.

Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Creativity is a muscle, you have to practice it every day. Once it stays the same, it’s no longer creative. [Without new experiences, your soul rots](chapter_1_self.md#on-comfort-and-risk).

Ignorance is a blessing, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Being ignorant about the market and the «right way» to do things allows them to come up with creative solutions to problems that experienced veterans would never have thought of.

> *'The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away.' -- Linus Pauling*

> *'If you accept conventional wisdom from conventional people living conventional lives. Can you expect to be anything other than conventional?'*

> *'We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process.' -- Josh Waitzkin*

> *'The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours.' -- Amos Tversky*

> *'The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident.' -- Mark Twain*

### How to judge ideas?

<!--
> *'A multitude of bad ideas is necessary for one good idea.' -- Kevin Kelly*
-->

Peers are the best judging ideas. Managers will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

However the right idea not executed is worth nothing and a mediocre one well executed can prove to be worth much. Instead of focusing on ideas, focus on transforming yourself into the kind of person who can bring them to life. 

> *'Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There’s no market for them. There’s no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn't mean other people will copy it. First they'll have to be convinced it’s a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else’s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they'll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they're more likely to do well with.'*

> *'Ideas, then good ideas, then execution, then Do-ing, then networking, then idea sex, then turning an idea into a future vision, then monetizing the idea. Then more ideas.' -- James Altucher*

## On analysis

<!--
- How can we overcome complexity bias? Occam’s razor suggests that the simplest solution or explanation is usually the correct one.
- confirmaton bias, the mother of all bias. In truth, we all believe in things we can’t prove. If you’re intelligent, well-educated, and good at pulling facts, you’re going to be even better at confirming your own beliefs than someone who’s less intelligent or well-educated. Our brains are wired so that we make better lawyers than we do scientists, in that a lawyer will look for and use evidence to support their client, while ignoring and definitely not using evidence that does the opposite. We only want to watch television shows or read articles or listen to podcasts that confirm what we already believe -- what we already think we know. best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it. Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts. Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy.
-->

> *'Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'There are no facts, only interpretations.' -- Friedrich Nietzsche*

> *'Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital.' -- Aaron Levenstein*

Analysis is an art, not a science.

The main problem with analysis is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered. Everyone is biased.

> *'Believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear.' -- Edgar Allan Poe*

> *'Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth.' -- Marcus Aurelius*

> *'What Susie says of Sally says more about Susie than of Sally.'*

> *'Each generation imagines itself to be more intelligent than the one that went before it, and wiser than the one that comes after it.' -- Orwell*

> *'Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?' -- George Carlin*

> *'Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'Opinions are like a shirt: everyone should have at least a basic one, and it’s okay to really love yours, but try to remember to change it every now and again.'*

> *'We don't look at what we look, but at what we are.' -- Fernando Pessoa*

> *'Don't tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I'll tell you what you value.' -- Joe Biden quoting his father*

> *'The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend.' -- Robertson Davies*

Be specially careful with *confirmation bias*. Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas. 
Too much info is the main cause of it: you'll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs.

> *'Experiment and theory often show remarkable agreement when performed in the same laboratory' -- Daniel Bershader*

> *'The hardest thing to explain is the glaringly evident that everyone has decided not to see.' -- Ayn Rand*

> *'The truth will set you free, but first it will piss you off.' -- Gloria Steinem*

> *'I look for ways of changing my mind. I never allow myself to have an opinion on anything that I don't know the other side’s argument better than they do. ' -- Chalie Munger*

> *'What the human being is best at doing is interpreting all new information so that their prior conclusions remain intact.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'That’s the thing about counterintuitive ideas, they contradict your intuitions. Of course your first impulse is to ignore them' -- Paul Graham*

And when facing new ideas. Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.

> *'You always get exaggerated notions of things you don’t know anything about.' -- Albert Camus*

> *'I am both worse and better than you thought.' -- Sylvia Plath*

> *'An unfamiliar city is a fine thing. That’s the time and place when you can suppose that all of the people you meet are nice.' -- Louis Céline*

> *'The truth is rarely pure and never simple.' -- Oscar Wilde*

### Hints

<!--
> *'To understand is to know what to do.' -- Wittgenstein*
> *'We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.'*

- if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.
- tese antitheses -> syntesis
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct. You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- What’s your advantage: informational, analytical, or behavioral?	
- not playing your hand but playing your opponent.
- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.
- Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.
- Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
- As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.
- As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths -- even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision -- are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth.

- Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.  
- «Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.  
- We always think that the people who agree with us are really smart.  
- Skepticism is a great servant and a terrible master.  
- Randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.  
- There’s always a good reason and a real reason.
- There's truth on *group* stereotypes. *Group* opinions self correct themselves.
- Prefer stats than a explanatory texts.

> *'Look for something that doesn't make sense. That’s where the gold mine is: «It doesn’t make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden. Don’t try to make sense of the world. It’s too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They're the ones that will make the assets price move.'  
'The most important question: «What do you need to see to change your view?»' -- Adam Robinson (paraphrased)*

## On planning

<!--

-->

> *'All battles are won or lost before they are ever fought.' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'If your goal does not have a schedule, it is a dream.' -- Kevin Kelly*

You can’t predict but you can prepare. Plan ahead and prepare for the highly probable scenarios.

> *'The best way to predict the future is to invent it.' -- Alan Kay*

> *'If I had 9 hours to chop down a tree, I'd spend the first six sharpening my ax.' -- Abraham Lincoln*

> *'He who fails to plan is planning to fail.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Hope is not a strategy.' -- Vince Lombardi*

> *'If you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there.' -- Lewis Carroll*

> *'The movie might be good or bad but in the end we'll finish eating pizza.' -- unknown*

> *'Someone is sitting in the shade today because someone planted a tree a long time ago.' -- Warren Buffett*

### How to plan? 

Start with a [vision](#on-creativity-vision-and-ideas). Then look for actionable steps.  

Choose the plan with more options. The one that lets you change plan. Plans are only a starting point.  
However too detailed plans (or too general plans) are not useful and a waste of time.

> *'Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others.' -- Johnathan Swift*

> *'A strategy has a single, well defined focus. A strategy lays out a path to be followed. A strategy is made up of parts (tactics). Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus. A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally.' -- Geoffrey P. Chamberlain*

> *'Strategy requires thought; tactics require observation.' -- Max Euwe*

> *'I always worked until I had something done and I always stopped when I knew what was going to happen next. That way I could be sure of going on the next day.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

> *'You make plans and god laughs.' -- Yiddish proverbs*

> *'Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the mouth.' -- Mike Tyson*

Don't sabotage them when they get tedious or too difficult.

## On decision making

<!--
- (kk) Don’t ever respond to a solicitation or a proposal on the phone. The urgency is a disguise.
> *'My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower.'*
- Wait 48 hours before buying stuff
> *'It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago.' -- Derek Sivers*
> *'Se não houvesse decisoes eramos todos iguais.' -- António Simões*

- Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct.
- the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no ’skin in the game' should give estimates.
- With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.
- Beliefs lag behind reality. But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.
- Actions > Thoughts; Actions change the world. Not beliefs.
- find 3 people that high expertise but that they discord and listen. take your conclusions
- The Problems With Goals: Goals have an endpoint. Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. Goals can make us complacent or reckless.
- Blue collar want to feel the same as others. White collar want to feel different from others.
- decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
- Your product is decisions.

> *'I am not a product of my circumstances. I am a product of my decisions.' -- Stephen Cove*

> *'May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears.' -- Nelson Mandela*

You are evaluated by your decisions.

We think we make choices but our choices are influenced by others. People pick what is familiar.

> *'Opportunity cost is how intelligent people assess things.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'A mistake repeated more than once is a decision.' -- Paulo Coelho*

### On mental models

<!--
market: supply and demand explain a lot of phenomenons
macro scale - high level / micro scale - low level: https://en.'*wikipedia.'*org/wiki/Level_of_analysis - everything is a system
high tech way / low tech way 
everything is: http://c2.'*com/cgi/wiki?EverythingIsa start from a main idea, then diverge
momentum: virtuous circle / vicious circle
spaced learning system: anki, supermemo, goldenlist
programming languages: type annotation theory / OO vs functional paradigm
log scales: hyperbolic function - pareto law 80/20 - plateaus
noise rate
great breakthroughs are always counter-intuitive

> *'All models are wrong but some are useful.' -- George Box*

> *'A model which took account of all the variation of reality would be of no more use than a map at the scale of one to one.' -- Joan Robinson*

All models are wrong. The practical question is how wrong do they have to be to not be useful. This is what a mental model is – a functional tool. If you don't understand his limitations, you don't understand the model.

> *'A map is not the territory it represents, but, if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness.' -- Alfred Korzybski*

> *'Scientists generally agree that no theory is one hundred percent correct. Thus, the real test of knowledge is not truth, but utility. Science gives us power. The more useful that power, the better the science.' -- Yuval Noah Harari*

> *'The basic trouble, you see, is that people think that «right» and «wrong» are absolute; that everything that isn't perfectly and completely right is totally and equally wrong.' -- Isaac Asimov*

### How to speed up decisions?

> *'The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action.' -- Daniel Gilber*

The ability to make fast decisions is a competitive advantage.

Some people get paralyzed by [over thinking](#on-starting-and-timing). When you don't decide somebody will decide for you.

> *'While we are reasoning concerning life, life is gone.' -- David Hume*

> *'Economics teaches you that making a choice means giving up something.' -- Russ Roberts*

Hints:
 
- Optimal decisions occur when one has 70% of the necessary information. Anything less than 70% and you’ll probably make a bad decision. But anything more than 70% and you’re probably wasting time on something that is unlikely to change the outcome. (Jeff Bezos)
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, we can make it fast and without perfect information. If a decision is irreversible, we should slow down the decision-making process and ensure that we consider ample information and understand the problem as thoroughly as we can. (Jeff Bezos)
- 'Hell yes or no'. Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. (Derek Sivers)  
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer. (Warren Buffett)  
- Default to no. (Steve Jobs)

# 3.2 - On executing

## On starting and timing

<!--
- you always throw out your first pancake - primeiro milho é para os pardais
- Enter action with boldness. Play the ball before it plays you. Waiting for troubles to come to you will only multiply them and give them a deadly momentum.
- Research is not doing something. Knowledge is never the issue, action is.
- The more “goal oriented” is the task, the more a potential 10x programmer
- Be useful, not important.
- monk mode -> no communication during mornings, only deep work -> meetings afternoon
- If something compounds at 1% a day, it will be 37 times better in a year. If something loses 1% a day, it will be 0.03% of what it was in a year. I know it’s hard to quantify. It’s impossible. But the direction is what is important. It will all shake out in the end. This is the path to improvement any area of life.
- jogar c o baralho todo / jogar com um subset
- letting go allows progress. letting things happen instead of trying things to happen.
- I can ignore what you’re saying, and just look at your actions. Our actions always reveal our real values.
- keep earning your title, or it expires. -- derek sivers
- The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were: Start with the answer first. Group and summarize your supporting arguments. Logically order your supporting ideas. Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”
- The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present _exactly_3 reasons: Your argument gets their attention and is memorable. You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons. You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.

-->

> *'A year from now, you will wish you had started today.' -- Karen Lamb*

> *'Hesitation is always easy, rarely useful' -- Prof. Quirrel alterego*

Just start.

Stop making resolutions and start making something. Time is the most precious thing you own.
Nothing happens in the world because of thought. Or because of talking. Or because of writing. It happens because of DO-ing.

> *'The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step' -- Lao Tzu*

> *'If everybody contemplates the infinite instead of fixing the drains, many of us will die of cholera.' -- John Rich*

> *'Do not wait to strike till the iron is hot; but make it hot by striking.' -- Yeats*

> *'The most difficult is the decision to act, the rest is just tenacity.' -- Andrea Earhart*

### Why people procrastinate?

> *'The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it.' -- Manson’s Law of Avoidance*

- [Perfectionism](chapter_1_self.md#on-perfectionism). You fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all.  
- Anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us. We procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety.
- No hope. When hope disappears, so does action.

> *'One of the counterintuitive things that I've learned is that procrastination is often a side-effect of perfectionism.' -- bane_HN*

> *'Go and do the things you can’t. That is how you get to do them.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'If opportunity doesn't knock, build a door.' -- Milton Berle*

### How to defeat procrastination?

Don't wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet. You will languish if you stop for a long time. Paralysis is worse than bad timing.

At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused (the panic monster). What gets measured gets done. 

> *'The best thing you can do is the right thing, the second best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Did you know you can't steer a boat that isn't moving? Just like a life.' -- Paul Lutus*

HOWEVER, never mistake action for motion. You must think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought. So make a [plan](#on-planning-and-decision-making). Any plan will do.

> *'A good plan, violently executed now, is better than a perfect plan next week.' -- General George Patton*

> *'No one ever wrote a plan to be fat lazy or stupid. That’s what happens when you don’t have a plan.' – Larry Winget*

> *'Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.'*

## On speed, position and direction

> *'Speed is useful only if you are running in the right direction.' -- Joel Barker*

> *'Start as close to the end as possible.' -- Kurt Vonnegu*

> *'Most people overestimate what they can do in one year and underestimate what they can do in ten years.' -- Bill Gates*

Direction is more important than velocity. Even if we can't choose the starting point, often, we can choose the direction.

When possible, position yourself for victory by bringing the target closer. Location is better than space amount so trade space for time.

> *'Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success.'*

Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.

> *'Far better an approximate answer to the right question, which is often vague, than an exact answer to the wrong question, which can always be made precise.' -- John Tukey*

> *'No matter how great the talent or efforts, some things just take time. You can’t produce a baby in one month by getting nine women pregnant.' -- Warren Buffett*

## On focus, priorities and productivity

<!--
- Protect your time like your money. Strategic laziness as a leverage point.
- maker days and manager days
- start ruthlessly cutting all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish report” might turn into “write report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- As John Stuart Mill said, “as few as you can, as many as you must.”
- Busy is a decision. What you are really saying: is not a priority. Is a excuse for not doing something we don't feel like doing.
- Focus on adaptability not effectiveness
- Schedule less time for important tasks. Be mindful of how you spend your time.
- Set yourself deadlines.
- complete at least 1 important but not urgent task per day.
- Media companies harvest your attention and transform it into revenue.
- If you’re not turning off part of your audience, then you’re not going to be fascinating,” she says; “you’re not going to be memorable.'*	
try to hit 10% of your followers instead of trying to hit all of them at the same time.
-->

> *'A woodpecker can tap twenty times on a thousand trees and get nowhere, but stay busy. Or he can tap twenty-thousand times on one tree and get dinner.' -- Seth Godin* 

> *'People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying «no» to 1000 things.' -- Steve Jobs*

First the essential. Then the details.

Focusing is an art. Time itself is not your limitation: attention is.  
Busy imply out of control. Lack of time is lack of priorities.

> *'Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all.' -- Tim Ferriss*

> *'Strike the shepherd and the sheep will scatter.' -- Robert Greene (42nd law of power)*

> *'You can do anything, but not everything.' -- David Allen*

> *'When everything is a priority nothing is a priority. Attempting to maximize competing variables is a recipe for disaster. Picking one variable, and relentlessly focusing on it, which is an effective strategy, diverges from the norm. It’s hard to compete with businesses who have correctly identified the right variables to maximize or minimize.' -- Charlie Munger*

> *'A man with a watch knows what time it is. A man with two watches is never sure.'*

> *'I want to know God’s thoughts; the rest are details.' -- Albert Einstein*

> *'You only have to do a very few things right in your life so long as you don't do too many things wrong.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Always look where you want to go, not where you don't want to go.'*

> *'As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value to you than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself' -- Arthur Schopenhauer*

### Productivity hints

Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity: it’s stupidity. Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. Productivity is about attention management. Do less to achieve more. You don't need to optimise everything.

20% of your effort will give you 80% of output: it may be enough or even more than enough. But 80/20 is fractal: If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value. So now 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value. So 4% of the work you do in life may create 64% of the benefits in your life.

Hints:

- Focus on 3 outcomes (not todos) per day and tackle the most important one in the morning.
- Set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and time-based goals. Always work with a specific purpose in mind.
- Be fully present: learn to focus on what you are doing now.
- Focus on the one thing most likely to get maximum results. Forget everything else. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place. Tackling a difficult problem is often a matter of seeing where the high leverage lies. Focus on doing the right things instead of doing things right.  
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk, Too many options may paralize you: remove them.
- When a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it—don’t add it to your to-do list or capture it for later.
- Protect your hours of real work. Separate “real hours” with breaks. Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Buy yourself time: delegate. Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- Work by layers: from functional to excellency.
- If you want a task done quickly, ask a busy person to do it.

## On control

<!--
- Não se pode fazer colecção de tudo.
- focus on what doesnt change
- we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe. 
-->

> *'You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink.' -- unknown* 

Control what you can: [what you’re primed by](introduction.md#the-real-you), [who you are around](chapter_2_groups.md#on-family-and-friends), the ideas and problems you [focus](#on-focus-priorities-and-productivity) on. Ignore the rest.

Consuming information gives the control freak an illusion of control. He doesn't want to acknowledge that the universe doesn't make sense and he doesn't trust himself to handle disorder in a situation that will get out of his league or skillset.

Disorder is not a mistake; it’s our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

Life is a balancing act. Most things are not binary.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite. The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *'Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop.' -- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It’s about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships and personal growth.

> *'Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.' -- unknown*

### How to balance an imbalance?

Overcompensate. Some people get passion from something they struggled with.

Plans are not static.

You need to switch strategies a few times to get where you want to go. When problems shift faster than your rate of adaptation you go extinct.

# 3.3 - On cooperating

## On selling, negotiation and price

<!--
- make clear agreements and hell yes agreements, keeping my agreements (90%), renegotiating agreements before they break, clean my agreements after breaking them.
- There is no such thing as "shortage" of anything. Just pay more, and you'll get it.
- always negotiate. dont communicate weakness on your negotiation. your first reaction should be no reaction. fight impulse to imediatelly give the answer.

- Responding to Job Offers for Maximum Impact
Letter One [Strong Response]
Bob, [First name: power play.]

I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]

I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]

I look forward to your response. [Power close.]

Cheers,
Alex “Dream Employee” Kouts
415.555.ALEX

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]

I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]

Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]

I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

Cheers,
Alex “Dream Employee” Kouts
415.555.ALEX

Always use first names (caveat: unless their title vastly exceeds yours — if they’re on LinkedIn, use how they address themselves there as a reference.)
Never make the first offer.
Thank them.
Set the tone for the negotiation.
Display social proof/market validation.
Set your “ask.”
Help them visualize the win.
Reiterate interest and close strong.

- First establish a baseline — use Google.
Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?”
“Will you do that -10%?”
“If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?”
“If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?”
“What if I pay cash?”
“Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.”
WALK AWAY.

- Unexpressed feelings never die. Releasing pressure is different from venting.
- The more influence somebody is the more they use we / plural pronouns.
- never split the difference
- Negotiate contracts in minute detail on the front end so that you aren’t negotiating after work is done, investments are made, and you have no bargaining power. This is especially important if the relationship between people is important as it avoids conflict later on.

- One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show.
I said, “$1500”. She said, “Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?”
I said, “$2000”. She said, “No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!”
I said, “Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.”
She liked that so much she came up with the $1500. -- Derek Sivers

- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like:
What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.

- Cold call all owners to rent. 8 said yes. Then auction! 
- To sell, you have to understand personalities, you have to learn what excites people, you have to over deliver, you have to understand competitors, etc.
Business is 80% psychological.
irritation -> challenge people to make something that they don't want to do
agitation -> challenge people to make something that they want to do.
agitate more than irritate.

> *'You don’t convince people by challenging their longest and most firmly held opinions. You find common ground and work from there. Or you look for leverage to make them listen. Or you create an alternative with so much support from other people that the opposition voluntarily abandons its views and joins your camp.' -- Ryan Holiday, The Obstacle Is the Way*
-->

We're all in sales. To sell is to deal with objections.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it’s mostly [applied persuasion](chapter_3_action.md#on-charming) and keeping [relationships](#on-relationships). Best sellers are now ambiverts. Being recomendend is the best marketing.

Traditional selling: hunters (extroverts)

- Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
- Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
- Persisting (to push until you make the sale)  

Modern selling: farmers (ambiverts and introverts)

- Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the Web, reading and analyzing information)  
- Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
- Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

Hints:

- Marketing is a symptom of excess production.
- People buy better versions of themselves, not products.
- Females buy male products. Males don't buy products targetted to females.
- Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.

> *'Marketers don’t convince. Engineers convince. Marketers persuade. Persuasion appeals to the emotions and to fear and to the imagination. Convincing requires a spreadsheet or some other rational device.' -- Seth Godin*

### On negotiation

<!--
- how to say no: When processing a “yes” or “no” to a request, don’t forget about your third option: negotiation.
- how to say no to an interview: i think i said already everthing about that subject.
- how to say no to something else: i think i did already what i can do.
- When people feel they have a choice, they «walk into your trap» that much more easily.
-->

You don’t get what you deserve in life, you only get what you negotiate.

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value).  
That said, a bad/good negotiation means that you are giving more/less value than receiving for it.

Hints:

- If you want to go fast, let the other part go first.
- You can only negotiate with integrous people.
- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating. The analytical cold guy is very patient. The assertive guy (eg. Trump) wants to make it fast. For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important.
- You don't need to match the other person mood, you should be playful and smart, taking the other to mirror your good mood also.
- Mirroring and reword. Repeating the last one to three words of the other person. It opens up people’s brain. Its' very effective. Test the firmness of what they want. People didn't even realize it.
- The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions.  
- «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- Never negotiate with binary questions: '«What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»'  
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.'
- Show arbitrage: If they pay X, now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the ONLY way to sell.
- To negotiate is to have options.

> *'Control the options: get others to play with the cards you deal.' -- Robert Greene (31st law of power)*

> *'When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude.' -- Robert Greene (13th law of power)*

> *'Flattery is the infantry of negotiation.' -- Lord Chandos*

> *'People may or may not say what they mean,” he explained, “but they always say something designed to get what they want.' -- David Mamet*

However always strive to achieve a win-win situation. When both sides don't take what they need from it, the deal may fall. The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.

> *'You can’t make a good deal with a bad person.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding.' -- Albert Einstein*

### On price

Price is a filter. Set it to choose the customers you prefer to work with. If they can’t pay, walk away.

> *'Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource.' -- Allen Tucker*

> *'Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing.' -- Oscar Wilde*

## On feedback and mentorship

<!--
what do i do that is most annoying to u? say thank you and don't discuss it. don't act on it. just put it in your mind.
-->

> *'I’d rather have criticism from a genius than praise from an idiot.'*

Feedback speeds up improvement but only take advice from mentors and "loving critics". Often they don't have the time to explain the logic behind their wisdom but they can show you the door.

> *'He who asks is a fool for five minutes, but he who does not ask remains a fool forever.' -- Chinese proverb*

> *'That is the great fallacy: the wisdom of old men. They do not grow wise. They grow careful.' -- Ernest Hemingway*

### How to find mentors?

Look for the «silver medalist». He has more availability, and sometimes, a better attitude than «the golden child».

> *'Don’t follow your mentors; follow your mentors’ mentors.' -- David Leach*

> *'Your father is your first mentor.'*

You should be a mentor yourself. Be [generous](/chapter_2_groups.md#on-rewards-and-generosity) and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

> *'One repays a teacher badly if one remains only a pupil.' -- Nietzsche*

> *'A society grows great when old men plant trees whose shade they know they shall never sit in.' -- Greek proverb*

> *'If you think you’re too small to make an impact, try to go to bed with a mosquito in the room.' -- Dalai Lama*

### How to mentor your kids?

> *'My advice is my autobiography not slogans. People relate better like that.' -- James Altucher*

> *'If you want your children to be intelligent, read them fairy tales. If you want them to be more intelligent, read them more fairy tales.' -- Albert Einstein*

Don't tell your kids how to live. Live fully and let them see. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar.

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know what is that for you and why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).  
- Fight perfectionism: «If you get a C or lower, I’ll buy you a present. If you score higher than that, I won’t buy you anything, because you won’t need it.»
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure.  
- Optimism: «You have the gift of today.»

> *'Children totally accept — and crave — family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'When a child asks an endless string of “why?” questions, the smartest reply is, “I don’t know, what do you think?”' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Be nice to your children because they are going to choose your nursing home.' -- Kevin Kelly*

However some people are not ready to accept your vision. And «givers» attract «takers»: remember that you [don't owe them](#on-freedom) anything.

> *'Do not teach a starving man to fish.'*

## On generosity and incentives

> *'No one has ever become poor by giving.' -- Anne Frank*

> *'He that gives should never remember and he that receives should never forget.' -- Talmud*

Always be generous. No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away. A low value gift may have the opposite effect.

> *'Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.'* 

> *'The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he'd learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I'll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn't be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people’s talents. He'd hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn't want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there.' -- HN_danielvf*

> *'My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn't lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human.' -- HN_danielvf*

> *'If you are giving back, it’s because you’ve taken too much.' -- Ricardo Semler*

### On incentives

Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.

The best way to learn complex behaviors is via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. After the behaviour is learnt, continuous reinforcement should become intermitent reinforcement.

However, the people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your time, presence and attention.

### On punishments

Extintion of rewards is more effective.

Punishment only works near the situation that cause it, triggers a fight-or-flight response and renders people aggressive and inhibits the ability to learn new and better responses.

Beware of all players.

People are amazing optimizers and will find any loopholes or gaps to their advantage. No one will help you in a way that is prejudicial to them.

Easy players are often just [deceiving](#on-charming) you. However - if you can identify them - there are people acting stupid that are easy wins.

> *'«El dorados» are never drawn in the map.'*

> *'Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the the universe.' -- Albert Einstein*

### On desperate opponents

Desperate players will risk everything in a fight. This gives them a huge advantage, they have nothing to lose.

> *'Don’t fight a starving animal. Never contend with a man who has nothing to Lose; for thereby you enter into an unequal conflict. The other enters without anxiety; having lost everything, including shame, he has no further loss to fear. He therefore re-sorts to all kinds of insolence.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

> *'Beware the fury of a patient man.' -- John Dryden*

> *'Beware of sad people.'*

### On difficult opponents

Besides outworking them, you'll need all weaponry. Sometimes even the «dirty stuff»: «pawn sacrifices», bribes and lying are examples of «dirty stuff». They may be effective but use them only on desperate situations: it’s a scar for life.

> *'Put all the meat in the barbecue.' -- Jorge Jesus (soccer coach)*

> *'Get others to do the work for you, but always take the credit.'  
'Keep your hands clean.' -- Robert Greene (7th and 26th laws of power)*

When nothing else works, [surrender](#on-surrendering). Only use anger and go all in if you can see the end already.

> *'Do I not destroy my enemies when I make them my friends?' -- Abraham Lincoln*

### On allies

The human strenght is our ability to cooperate. Heros are fictional stories.

## On defeating status quo

<!--
- burocracy prevents low probability events to happen at the expense of making more systems that the other people must comply and that take happiness from them.
-->

> *'To successfully change a status quo maintained by a minority you only need to unite the majority. How? Make a non-violent revolution: low risk will make more people to participate.' -- Srdja Popovic*

The only successful changes are those coming from within.

> *'You cannot find peace by avoiding life.' -- Virginia Woolf*




---
## On creating imbalances

<!--
> *'Make others dependent on you: hope has a good memory, gratitude a bad one. More is to be got from dependence than from courtesy.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

- In any system where there are norms, there are strengths and weaknesses to those norms. If you follow the norms of the system, the results you get are likely to be the norm. When you play a different game, a metagame, you have the opportunity to outperform.
-->

> *'Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.' -- Napoleon*

Create imbalances in your target to create an advantage and raise chances of winning.  
Use methods like [unpredictability](#on-unpredictability), [deceiving](#on-deceiving), [mirroring](#on-mirroring)
and [bait](#on-charming). Some opponents may require special tools.

Strategy is about winning before the battle begins, while tactics are about striking at weakness.

> *'The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed.' -- Richard Rumelt*

Some hints:

- Keeping your enemies on the defensive and in react mode will have a demoralizing effect on them.  
- If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.  
- Beware of counter-attacking: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.  
- In essence, for a change to occur, you must apply more energy to the system than is extracted by the system.  
- Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex, habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.  
- Divide and conquer.

## On leverage

<!--
> *'All guns are loaded.' -- Kevin Kelly*

- What works at a small scale (say, a Utopian community), loses its effectiveness as it scales. Everything has a breakpoint.
Their cheating had a small individual effect initially, so it went unnoticed. But the follow-on effect to individual cheating is group cheating, and the utopian goal of To each according to his need, from each according to his ability had the effect of expanding everyone’s needs and shrinking their ability, aided by envy and reciprocation effects.
- Finding cassandras to stop catastrophes. The “Cassandras” are experts in their field. These people are data driven.
-->

> *'Give me a lever long enough, and a place to stand, and I will move the earth.' -- Archimedes*

Leverage is a force multiplier for your judgement.

> *'Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They're the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
An army of robots is freely available - it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it.' -- Naval Ravikant*

## On charming

<!--
- All in all, just keep it simple. Don’t try to complicate the situation. Focus on being yourself, enjoying yourself. If you’re not having a good time, chances are good that people around you aren’t either. Charm is not about trying to pile on a bunch of techniques or manipulating people. It’s actually the complete opposite: letting human nature do its thing.
-->

> *'We catch more flies with honey than vinegar.'*

Charm the enemy and find their weaknesses. Then [exploit them](#on-deceiving).

'Pose as a friend, work as a spy.'  
'Discover each man’s thumbscrew.'  
'Work on the hearts and minds of others.' -- Robert Greene (12th, 14th, 33rd and 43rd laws of power)*

- People’s need for validation and recognition, their need to feel important, is the best kind of weakness to exploit.  
- To persuade up, focus on interests; to persuade down focus on emotions.  
- Use absence and bait to attract people. However use absence with moderation or soon you'll not be needed.It will become a challenge for them to win your affections. The ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression.  
- Instead of killing, charm the snake to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. First they have to trust you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy has always to prove himself.  

> *'Make other people come to you: use bait if necessary.'  
'Learn to keep people dependent on you.'  
Use absence to increase respect and honor.' -- Robert Greene (8th, 11th and 16th laws of power)*

> *'To combat an adversary, become their friend.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Treating a person to a meal never fails, and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'Compliment people behind their back. It’ll come back to you.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On deceiving

<!--
- Bad liars should speak as little as possible.
- if somebody asks for the evidence, normally, he’s lieing
- the good reason and the real reason.
-->

> *'A man is not deceived by others, he deceives himself.' -- Goethe*

> *'I've never fooled anyone. I've let people fool themselves. They didn't bother to find out who and what I was. Instead they would invent a character for me. I wouldn't argue with them. They were obviously loving somebody I wasn't.' -- Marilyn Monroe*

If we play by the rules too strictly, if we take them too literally, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish. Clean players on shady markets usually don't do well on the long term.

By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you.

> *'The moment a magician says, «now we begin» you’re already screwed!' -- Brian Brushwood*

> *'Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'The senses do not deceive; it is the judgment that deceives.' -- Goethe*

> *'Court attention at all cost.'  
'Play a sucker to catch a sucker: seem dumber than your mark.'  
'Play to people’s fantasies.'  
'Create compelling spectacles.'  
'Stir up waters to catch fish.' -- Robert Greene (6th, 21st, 32nd, 37th and 39th laws of power)*

> *'Honesty is a very expensive gift, don't expect it from cheap people.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'Never tell the truth to people who are not worthy of it.' -- Mark Twain*

> *'One thing I learned at 3 AM: everyone lied to survive. Truth is a luxury we day-people take for granted.' -- James Altucher*

However, deceiving is not lying. Disappointment destroys trust. Lying is like a nuclear bomb. The effects will be there for a long time to you to deal with.

> *'It’s hard to cheat an honest man.' -- Kevin Kelly*

> *'I’m not upset that you lied to me. I'm upset that from now on I can’t believe on you.' -- Nietzsche*

> *'Don't lie to anybody that you are not going to kill. Lying is a bad idea. The lie is going to burn you.' -- Hostage negotiator*

> *'The evil that men do lives after them; The good is often interred with their bones.' -- Julius Caesar; Act 3, Scene II*

> *'A lie can travel half way around the world while the truth is putting on its shoes.' -- Mark Twain*

And don't attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness. So never be mean to anybody that can hurt you by doing nothing.

> *'Any sufficiently advanced negligence is indistinguishable from malice.' -- Deb Chachra*

### On lies

> *'Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear.' -- Hannah Arendt*

> *'When you have something to say, silence is a lie.' --  Jordan Peterson*




---
## On unpredictability

<!--
Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.
-->

> *'Conceal your intention.'  
'Say less than necessary.'  
'Keep others in suspended terror: cultivate an air of unpredictability.'  
'Assume formlessness.' -- Robert Greene (3rd, 4th, 17th and 48th laws of power)*

However unpredictability can work against you: if you are in a subordinate position, it reduces trust.




---
## On mirroring

> *'Disarm and infuriate with the mirror effect.' -- Robert Greene (44th law of power)*

Reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation. We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

> *'Being pacifist in face of wolves is the source of endless tragedy.'*

> *'Don’t treat people as bad as they are. Treat them as good as you are.' -- Kevin Kelly*

# 3.4 - On ending

## On finishing

> *'If you’re going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don’t even start.' -- Charles Bukowski*

Starting is fun but success belongs to finishers.

[Going halfway](#on-focus-time-management-and-productivity) is a waste. When the end finally comes, it comes quickly.

> *'Only put off until tomorrow what you are willing to die having left undone.' -- Pablo Picasso*

> *'Crush your enemy totally.' -- Robert Greene (15th law of power)*

> *'Ultimately the only peace and security you can hope for from your enemies is their disappearance.'*

> *'You finished ahead of time, that means you forgot something.'*

> *'Difficulties increase the nearer we come to our aim.' -- Goethe*

> *'All endings are also beginnings. We just don’t know it at the time.' -- Mitch Albom*

> *'Bad things can happen fast, but almost all good things happen slowly.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On winning

<!--
- quem ganha a maioria dos duelos normalmente ganha o jogo. micro e o macro -- sergio conceição
- tecnically win or fundamentally win
-->

> *'Maintain reserves. A man should not employ all his capacity and power at once and on every occasion. Even in knowledge there should be a rearguard, so that your resources are doubled. One must always have something to resort to when there is fear of a defeat.' -- Balthasar Gracian*

> *'Winning isn’t everything, but wanting to win is.' -- Vince Lombardi*

It’s not just about winning. The way you win sets you up for the next round.

Winning is not the end of the road; it’s just a stop along the way.

> *'Win through your actions, never through argument.'  
'Make your accomplishments seem effortless.' -- Robert Greene (9th and 30th laws of power)*

> *'You only find out who is swimming naked when the tide goes out.' -- Warren Buffett*

> *'You might be winning but you’re not growing, and growing might be the most important form of winning.' -- Jordan Peterson*

> *'The war will be ended by the exhaustion of nations rather than the victories of armies.' -- Winston Churchill*

> *'Supreme excellence consists of breaking the enemy’s resistance without fighting' -- Sun Tzu*

> *'Never attempt to win by force what can be won by deception.' -- Machiavelli*

> *'You don't win by predicting the future; you win by getting the odds right.' -- Will Bonner*

## On surrendering

> *'It only hurts when you don’t have time to prepare for the fall' -- Tony Hawk*

> *'Waiting is painful. Forgetting is painful. But not knowing which to do is the worst kind of suffering.' -- Paulo Coelho*

In order to come back you have to go away.

Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. If you didn’t quit anything you would be still playing with toddlers. Sometimes good things fall apart so better things can fall together. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning. Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it give you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.

> *'Close some doors today. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they lead you nowhere.' -- Paul Coelho*

> *'Once the game is over, the king and the pawn go back in the same box.' -- Italian proverb*

> *'In all things — except love — start with the exit strategy. Prepare for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into than out of.' -- Kevin Kelly*

## On forgiveness and revenge

> *'The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive.' -- John Green*

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.

Forgiveness is a process of release so the opposite is a decision to hold onto something. By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.

> *'People find it far easier to forgive others for being wrong than being right.' -- J.K. Rowling*

> *'Life has become immeasurably better since I have been forced to stop taking it seriously.' -- Hunter S. Thompson*

> *'If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn’t part of ourselves doesn’t disturb us.' -- Hermann Hesse*

However:

> *'Once you had put the pieces back together, even though you may look intact, you were never quite the same as you'd been before the fall.' -- Jodi Picoult*

### On revenge

> *'An eye for an eye will only make the whole world blind.' -- Mahatma Gandhi*

> *'The greatest revenge is success.' -- Frank Sinatra*
