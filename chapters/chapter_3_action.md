# 3.1 - On preparing action

## On creativity

<!--
> *"Society may give an exclusive right to the profits arising from them, as an encouragement to men to pursue ideas which may produce utility, but this may or may *not be done, according to the will and convenience of the society, without claim or complaint from any body.*
> *"The best defense against logic is ignorance.*
-->

> *"The secret to creativity is knowing how to hide your sources."  
-- Albert Einstein*

Creative minds are rarely tidy. We don’t have an «imagination» we have a memory. Creativity is subtraction.

> *"Good artists copy; great artists steal."  
-- Steve Jobs & others*

> *"Those who do not want to imitate anything, produce nothing."  
-- Salvador Dali*

> *"To invent, you need a good imagination and a pile of junk."  
-- Thomas Edison*

> *"The ability to see order in chaos is called creativity."  
-- Simon Sinek*

> *"Consistency is the last refuge of the unimaginative."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"A pile of rocks ceases to be a rock when somebody contemplates it with the idea of a cathedral in mind."  
-- Antoine St. Exupery*

> *"One’s mind, once stretched by a new idea, never regains its original dimensions."  
-- Oliver Wendell Holmes*

> *"I know quite certainly that I myself have no special talent. Curiosity, obsession and dogged endurance, combined with self-criticism, have brought me to my ideas."  
-- Albert Einstein*

### How to find good ideas?

> *"The way to get good ideas is to get lots of ideas and throw the bad ones away."  
-- Linus Pauling*

Best ideas come from the market, not from you. Changes in the environment unlock opportunities.

Creativity is a muscle. Without new experiences, it atroffiates. Ideas born out of free time, play and boredom. Ignorance is a blessing, gives you freedom to think about stuff. Conventional people living conventional lives lead to conventional ideas.

> *"I begin with an idea and then it becomes something else."  
-- Pablo Picasso*

> *"Name the greatest of all inventors. Accident."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"We can’t solve problems by using the same kind of thinking we used when we created them."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"I cultivate empty space as a way of life for the creative process."  
-- Josh Waitzkin*

> *"The secret to doing good research is always to be a little underemployed. You waste years by not being able to waste hours."  
-- Amos Tversky*

> *"The mind that opens to a new idea never returns to its original size."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"Using creativity to solve problems cannot be taught, and it’s ultimately what free markets pay for." (...)  
"A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to create anything great."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can’t write and edit, or sculpt and polish, or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgement."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

> *"Nearly every man who develops an idea works it up to the point where it looks impossible, and then he gets discouraged. That’s not the place to become discouraged."  
-- Thomas Edison*

> *"If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange these ideas, then each of us will have two ideas."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

### How to judge ideas?

Ask peers. Managers will regret more a false positive than a false negative.

However the right idea not executed is worth nothing and a mediocre one well executed can be worth much. So focus on transforming yourself into the kind of person who can bring them to life. 

> *"New ideas pass through three periods: 1) It can’t be done; 2) It probably can be done, but it’s not worth doing; 3) I knew it was a good idea all along!"  
-- Arthur C. Clarke*

> *"Ideas by themselves are roughly worthless. There’s no market for them. There’s no place where one can go and buy an idea. Describing your idea in detail doesn’t mean other people will copy it. First they’ll have to be convinced it’s a good idea. If you ever tried to change anyone else’s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they’ll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they’re more likely to do well with."*

> *"Creativity and critical thinking: In subordinate position it gets you labelled a dreamer, a weirdo, or an idiot. In executive position, visionary, maverick, multidisciplinary thinker, etc. You can only truly creative in a position with autonomy, so you either climb the ladder or start your own thing."  
-- HN_dilemma*

> *"No grand idea was ever born in a conference, but a lot of foolish ideas have died there."  
-- F. Scott Fitzgerald*

> *"If at first, the idea is not absurd, then there is no hope for it."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"An idea that is not dangerous is unworthy of being called an idea at all."  
-- Oscar Wilde*

> *"We often refuse to accept an idea merely because the tone of voice in which it has been expressed is unsympathetic to us."  
-- Friedrich Nietzche*

> *"Almost all really new ideas have a certain aspect of foolishness when they are just produced."  
-- Alfred North Whitehead*

> *"A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a quip and worried to death by a frown on the right man’s brow."  
-- Ovid*

> *"There is one thing stronger than all the armies in the world, and that is an idea whose time has come."  
-- Victor Hugo*

> *"Nothing is more dangerous than an idea when it is the only one you have."  
-- Emile Chartier*






---
## On analysis

> *"There are no facts, only interpretations."  
-- Friedrich Nietzsche*

Analysis is an art, not a science. The main problem with analysis is our human tendency to think that what we see is all there is, without realizing that what we see is being filtered.

I don’t trust words. I even question actions. But I never doubt patterns.

> *"Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."  
-- Albert Einstein*

> *"Statistics are like bikinis. What they reveal is suggestive, but what they conceal is vital."  
-- Aaron Levenstein*

> *"Believe only half of what you see and nothing that you hear."  
-- Edgar Allan Poe*

> *"Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth."  
-- Marcus Aurelius*

> *"What Susie says of Sally says more about Susie than of Sally."*

> *"Have you ever noticed that anybody driving slower than you is an idiot, and anyone going faster than you is a maniac?"  
-- George Carlin*

> *"Whenever you find yourself on the side of the majority, it is time to pause and reflect."  
-- Mark Twain*

> *"We don’t look at what we look, but at what we are."  
-- Fernando Pessoa*

> *"Don’t tell me what you value. Show me your budget, and I’ll tell you what you value."  
-- Joe Biden quoting his father*

> *"The eye sees only what the mind is prepared to comprehend."  
-- Robertson Davies*

> *"The power of accurate observation is commonly called cynicism by those who have not got it."  
-- George Bernard Shaw*

> *"To doubt everything or to believe everything are two equally convenient solutions; both dispense the necessity of reflection."  
-- Henri Poincaré*

### Hints

<!--
> *"To understand is to know what to do."  
-- Wittgenstein*
> *"Whenever there is an argument between two sides, find the third side."  
-- Kevin Kelly*
> *"Anything you say before the word «but» does not count."  
-- Kevin Kelly*
> *"If you don’t know, it’s because you are not interested in it."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

- Two people with opposing views on a topic can see the same evidence, and still come away both validated by it. Evaluating evidence (especially when it is complicated or unclear) requires a great deal of mental energy. Our brains prefer to take shortcuts. Accepting information which confirms our beliefs is easy and requires little mental energy.
- if you tell someone the person they’re about to meet is extroverted, they’re more likely to describe them as extroverted.
- tese antitheses -> syntesis
- The very act of stopping to think before you say or do anything almost always improves the quality of your ultimate response.
Create a negative or reverse hypothesis. This is the opposite of your initial theory. For example, you are Isaac Newton, and the idea of gravity has just occurred to you. Your initial hypothesis would be that “things fall down.” You then attempt to prove the opposite—“things fall up.” If you cannot prove the reverse or negative hypothesis of your idea, you can then conclude that your hypothesis is correct. You need to search out disconfirming evidence.
- The first time it breaks, you blame the manufacturer. The second time, and every time after that, you blame the repair shop. For a repair shop, servicing appliances from a bad vendor can damage your reputation. Since then, every time I make an appliance purchase – vacuum cleaner, dishwasher, car – I go to a repair shop. They’re always excited to talk to someone who will listen. They may even have a used model that will last you for years.
- Simple rules focus on the critical variables that govern a situation and help you ignore the peripheral ones. Of course, in order to identify the key variables, you need to be operating in your circle of competence.
- Everybody is a genious but if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
- As Rebecca Goldstein wrote in Incompleteness: The Proof and Paradox of Kurt Godel: All truths -- even those that had seemed so certain as to be immune to the very possibility of revision -- are essentially manufactured. Indeed, the very notion of the objectively true is a socially constructed myth.
-->

- Prefer stats than narratives. We have two kinds of forecasters: The ones who don’t know and the ones who don’t know they don’t know.
- There’s always a good reason and a real reason.
- Look for something that doesn’t make sense. That’s where the gold mine is: «It doesn’t make sense, the price is going down!». The world makes sense, just not the model. Some X factor is hidden. Don’t try to make sense of the world. It’s too complicated. Instead watch investors attempting to make sense of it. They’re the ones that will make the assets price move. (Adam Robinson)
- Randomness: most facts are a «tell» but some are just random.  
- Skepticism is a great servant and a terrible master.  
- There’s truth on *group* stereotypes. *Group* opinions self correct themselves.
- We tend to think that the people who agree with us are really smart.  
- Create a hypothesis, a yet-to-be-proven theory. Then seek ways to invalidate this hypothesis, to prove that your idea is wrong. This is what scientists do. This is exactly the opposite of what most people do. They come up with an idea, and then they seek corroboration and proof that their idea is a good one. They practice “confirmation bias.” They only look for confirmation of the validity of the idea, and they simultaneously reject all input or information that is inconsistent with what they have already decided to believe.
- Pay attention to negative cues: what should have happened but did not.
- «Chekov bottle»: If something is described in a previous chapter, it means it will be important for the action in a future chapter.  
- Best way to deal with confirmation bias: You need to search out disconfirming evidence. Confirmation bias is our tendency to cherry pick information which confirms pre-existing beliefs or ideas. Too much info is the main cause of it: you’ll always find confirmation to your pre-existing beliefs. As a consequence, we tend to see more evidence which enforces our worldview. Confirmatory data is taken seriously, while disconfirmatory data is treated with scepticism. To constantly evaluate our worldview would be exhausting, so we prefer to strengthen it. confirmation bias: As music unfolds, the brain constantly updates its estimates of when new beats will occur, and takes satisfaction in matching a mental beat with a real-in-the-world one.
- Nothing is as simple at seems at first, or as hopeless as it seems in the middle, or as finished as it seems in the end.
- Nothing is as good or as bad as it seems.
- Bragging razor: if someone brags assume half. if someone downplays double it.

### On truth

> *"It is easier for the world to accept a simple lie than a complex truth."  
-- Alexis de Tocqueville*

> *"The truth is rarely pure and never simple."  
-- Oscar Wilde*\

> *"There are 3 truths: my truth, your truth, and the truth."  
-- Chinese Proverb*

Truth does not mind to be questioned. A lie does not like being challenged.

In a world of propaganda, the truth is always a conspiracy. If you tell the truth you don’t need to reharse anything.

You can’t predict but you can prepare for the highly probable scenarios.

> *"What you think is your problem is not your problem, your strategy is."  
-- Dan Munro*

### How to plan?

> *"Divide each difficulty into as many parts as is feasible and necessary to resolve it."  
-- Descartes*

Start with a vision. Then look for actionable steps.  

Hints:

- Plans are only a starting point. Choose a plan with options. A plan is only useful if it can survive reality. And a future filled with unknowns is everyone’s reality. Too detailed plans (or too general plans) are not useful and a waste of time. The most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.
- Don’t sabotage them when they get tedious or too difficult.
- Actions aligned with goals.
- Quality is the best business plan.

> *"Vision is the art of seeing what is invisible to others."  
-- Johnathan Swift*

> *"A strategy has a single, well defined focus. A strategy lays out a path to be followed. A strategy is made up of parts (tactics). Each of a strategy’s parts pushes towards the defined focus. A strategy is either intentionally formed or emerges naturally."  
-- Geoffrey P. Chamberlain*

> *"Strategy requires thought; tactics require observation."  
-- Max Euwe*

> *"I always worked until I had something done and I always stopped when I knew what was going to happen next. That way I could be sure of going on the next day."

## On decision making

<!--
> *"It’s a common belief that your first reaction is the most honest, but I disagree. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it’s an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it’s triggering a knee-jerk emotional response to something that happened long ago."  
-- Derek Sivers*

> *"Don’t ask the barber whether you need a haircut."

> *"There is no exception to the rule that everybody likes to be an exception to the rule."  
-- Malcolm Forbes*
> *"Clear thinkers take feedback from reality, not society." (...)  
"The three big decisions: where you live, who you’re with, and what you’re doing." (...)  
"In the age of infinite leverage, judgement is the most important skill." (...)  
"Clear thinking comes from having time to reflect and pursue your genuine intellectual curiosity." (...)  
"The only part you can’t outsource is judgement."  
-- Naval Ravikant*

> *"My brother says to never make a big decision before you take a shower."*
- Wait 48 hours before buying stuff
- for every complex problem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong.
- indecision comes from not knowing what you want. they don’t know what matters to them nor have found something larger then themselves to commit to.
- everything is a trade-off.
- a good decision is risking little for the opportunity to gain a lot. and vice-versa.
- people are punished for bad decisions and rarely rewarded for good decisions.
- Ask yourself “does this decision require fast or slow thinking?” 
- Occam’s razor states that the simplest solution is usually correct.
- the most important decision that you will make is not whether or not you should start something, but whether or not you should stay with something.
- estimates are promises. What makes promises special is that once you promise something it is expected that you ACT upon realizing it. No one that has no ’skin in the game’ should give estimates.
- With practice, we also get better at recognizing bad decisions and pivoting, rather than sticking with past choices due to the sunk costs fallacy. Equally important, we can stop viewing mistakes or small failures as disastrous and view them as pure information which will inform future decisions.
As further guidance, Bezos considers 70% certainty to be the cut-off point where it is appropriate to make a decision. That means acting once we have 70% of the required information, instead of waiting longer. Making a decision at 70% certainty and then course-correcting is a lot more effective than waiting for 90% certainty.
- Beliefs lag behind reality. But think about some of the things you believed ten years ago… aren’t you embarrassed by some of them? Don’t you wonder how you could’ve ever believed something so ridiculous? Yeah. Exactly. So what are you going to think about the beliefs you have now in ten years?
Knowledge is always moving forward, and it’s probably moving forward a lot faster now than it ever has been. So if we’re going to assume anything, it shouldn’t be that we’re right, but that we’re wrong. Better to be a skeptic than to be delusional.
- Actions > Thoughts; Actions change the world. Not beliefs.
- find 3 people that high expertise but that they discord and listen. take your conclusions
- The Problems With Goals: Goals have an endpoint. Goals rely on factors which we do not always have control over. Goals rely on willpower and self-discipline. Goals can make us complacent or reckless.
- Blue collar want to feel the same as others. White collar want to feel different from others.
- decisions are tainted by the emotional investments you accumulate, and the more you invest in something the harder it becomes to abandon it.
- Your product is decisions. 
-->

> *"May your choices reflect your choices, not your fears."  
-- Nelson Mandela*

You are evaluated by your decisions. Getting 80% good decisions is exponentially better than 70%.

We think we make choices but our choices are influenced by others. We pick what is familiar.

### How to speed up decisions?

> *"The world doesn’t have the luxury of waiting for complete answers before it takes action."  
-- Daniel Gilber*

Fast decisions are a competitive advantage but most people get paralyzed by over thinking. If you don’t decide timely somebody will do it for you.

Hints:
 
- Default to no. (Steve Jobs)
- ’Hell yes or no’. Say no to things you aren’t really excited about doing. (Derek Sivers)  
- No to any decision that requires a calculator or computer. (Warren Buffett)  
- With two equally difficult paths, choose the one more painful in the sort term. Pain avoidance is creating an illusion of equality. (Naval Ravikant)
- Choose the one that may produce most serendipity down the line.
- Is the decision reversible or irreversible? If it is reversible, make it fast and without perfect information. If is irreversible, slow down and ensure that you understand the problem. (Jeff Bezos)
- Optimal decisions occur with 70% of the information. Anything less and you’ll probably make a bad decision. Anything more and you’re probably wasting time on something that is unlikely to change the outcome. (Jeff Bezos)

A mental model is a functional tool. If you don’t understand its limitations, you don’t understand the model. The practical question is how limited do they have to be to not be useful.

- The key take-aways from the Pyramid Principle at McKinsey were: Start with the answer first. Group and summarize your supporting arguments. Logically order your supporting ideas. Then, for each supporting idea or argument, break that further into more ideas or arguments until you have formed a pyramid. The Pyramid Principle teaches that, “Ideas at any level in the pyramid must always be summaries of the ideas grouped below them.”
- The Rule of 3. Whenever you’re trying to persuade a senior person to do something, always present _exactly_3 reasons: Your argument gets their attention and is memorable. You are forced to choose the 3 most important reasons. You sound more structured, confident and decisive when you speak.

### On procrastination

> *"The more something threatens your identity, the more you will avoid it."  
-- Mark Manson*

We fear releasing something unimportant, so you don’t release anything at all. Inadequacy of results makes us realize that we are not as good as we think we are and creates anxiety. We distract ourselves because we are not willing to face up with what bothers us. We procrastinate in order to remove that anxiety. When hope disappears, so does action.

How to defeat procrastination?

Hints:

- What gets measured gets done.
- Don’t wait for the perfect occasion, a good occasion is a safer bet.  You will languish if you stop for a long time and paralysis is worse than bad timing.
 At some point, the pain of not doing it becomes greater than the pain of doing it. Pressed by circumstances, we feel unusually energized and focused (the panic monster). 
- However, never mistake action for motion. You must think like a man of action, and act like a man of thought. So make a plan. Any plan will do.

> *"Start as close to the end as possible."  
-- Kurt Vonnegu*

Direction is more important than velocity. Even if we can’t choose the starting point, often, we can choose the direction.

When possible, position yourself for victory by bringing the target closer. Location is better than space amount so trade space for time.

> *"Moving in a direction opposite to what we are doing right now where we are not successful will guarantee success."*

Only fools rush into a situation. By committing too quickly you lose your maneuverability.

> *"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying «no» to 1000 things."  
-- Steve Jobs*

First the essential. Then the details.

Focusing is an art. Time itself is not your limitation: attention is.  
Busy imply out of control. Lack of time is lack of priorities.

> *"Doing something well does not make it important. I think this is one of the most common problems with a lot of time-management or productivity advice; they focus on how to do things quickly. The vast majority of things that people do quickly should not be done at all."

### On productivity

<!--
> *"If you’re not spending your time doing what you want, and you’re not earning, and you’re not learning - what the heck are you doing?" (...)  
"Nothing will make you more productive than owning your time. Nothing will make you less productive than selling it." (...)

-->

> *"As few as you can, as many as you must."  
-- John Stuart Mill*

Getting a lot of unnecessary things done is not productivity, it’s stupidity.

Saying yes to everything is a quick road to mediocrity. Productivity is about attention management. Do less to achieve more. You don’t need to optimise everything. 20% of your effort will give you 80% of output and it may be more than enough. 

Hints:

- Protect your time like your money. Protect your hours of real work. Take advantage of early hours in the day.
- Focus on one to three outcomes per day (include one important but not urgent task) and tackle the most important one in the morning. Leverage is built on the notion that small, well-focused actions can sometimes produce significant, enduring improvements if they are applied in the right place.
- 80/20 is fractal: If 20% of the effort creates 80% of the value, 20% of the 20% of the effort makes 80% of 80% of the value. So 4% of the work you do may create 64% of the benefits!
- Ruthless cut all the activities in your workday that aren’t producing value.
- Always work with a specific purpose in mind. Set specific, measurable, realistic and time-based goals.
- Mind the process, not the results. For example, “finish report” might turn into “write report for 45 uninterrupted minutes.”
- Learn to focus and being fully present on what you are doing now.
- Work by layers: from functional to excellency.
- Do things in batch. Interruption and switching between tasks costs too much. Reduce decision making on small tasks to a minimum and do it quickly and in bulk.
- When a task will take you less than two minutes, just do it.
- Buy yourself time: delegate. Only operate from strengths: outsource your weaknesses. Focus on what you’re naturally good at and what you enjoy the most.
- To get anything done quickly, ask a busy person to do it.

## On control

<!--
- Não se pode fazer colecção de tudo.
- focus on what doesnt change
- never let the things you can’t do distract from the things you can.
- we can define entropy as a measure of the disorder of the universe. 
-->

> *"You can lead a horse to water but you can’t make him drink."  
-- unknown*

Disorder is not a mistake; it’s our default. Order is always artificial and temporary.

Control what you can: what you’re primed by, who you are around, the ideas and problems you focus on. Ignore the rest.

Consuming information gives the control freak an illusion of control. He doesn’t want to acknowledge that the universe doesn’t make sense and he doesn’t trust himself to handle disorder in a situation that will get out of his league or skillset.

## On balance

<!--
- alguem mais loose q tu é um maluco, mais tight é um nhónhó. somos a medida de tudo
-->

> *"Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler."  
-- Albert Einstein*

Life is a balancing act. Most things are not binary.

The dose makes the poison: things in excess become their opposite. The hardest skill is knowing when to stop.

> *"Do not go past the mark you aimed for; in victory, learn when to stop."  
-- Robert Greene (47th law of power)*

Balance is not about spending the same amount of time focused on every area of your life either. It’s about making progress in all areas of your life and ensuring that you improve just a little bit each day in your health, wealth, relationships and personal growth.

Hints:

- Don’t try to make your job your whole life. Don’t try to make your art your sole income.
- There are two approaches to improving yourself: 1) The self-improvement junkie. 2) The self-improvement tourists. (Mark Manson)

> *"Life is a balance between holding on and letting go."  
-- Rumi*

### How to balance an imbalance?

Overcompensate. Some people get passion from something they struggled with.

-- Tor Blair*

Plans are not static.

> *"When the winds of change blow, some people build walls while others build windmills."  
-- Chinese proverb*

> *"If I don’t have red, I use blue."  
-- Pablo Picasso*

### How to change?

> *"It is much easier to change how you think by changing your behavior, than it is to change your behavior by changing how you think. Act out the change you seek."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

There are limits on change. Willpower is finite and change requires attention. However, small changes in a complex system can cause large changes. 

> *"Preach the need for change, but never reform too much at once."  
-- Robert Greene (45th law of power)*

> *"Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake."  
-- Napoleon Bonaparte*

Leverage is a force multiplier.

Strategy is about winning before the battle begins, tactics are about striking at weakness.

Leverage your target weaknesses to raise your chances of winning.  
Use methods like unpredictability, charming or mirroring. Even deceiving, some opponents may require special tools.

> *"The most basic idea of strategy is the application of strength against weakness. Or if you prefer, strength applied to the most promising opportunity.
A good strategy doesn’t just draw on existing strength; it creates strength. Rumelt’s definition of strategy as creating strength is particularly important. You don’t deplete yourself as you execute your strategy. You choose tactics that reinforce and build strength as they are deployed."  
-- Richard Rumelt*

> *"Fortunes require leverage. Business leverage comes from capital, people and products with no marginal cost of replication (code and media).
Capital means money. To raise money, apply your specific knowledge, with accountability and show resulting good judgment. Labor means people working for you. It’s the oldest and most fought-over form of leverage. Labor leverage will impress your parents, but don’t waste your life chasing it. Capital and labor are permissioned leverage. Everyone is chasing capital, but someone has to give it to you. Everyone is trying to lead, but someone has to follow you.
Code and media are permissionless leverage. They’re the leverage behind the newly rich. You can create software and media that works for you while you sleep.
An army of robots is freely available - it’s just packed in data centers for heat and space efficiency. Use it."  
-- Naval Ravikant*


Hints:

- If you control the overall direction and framing of the battle, anything they do will play into your hands.
- Divide and conquer.
- Beware of counter-attacking: the problems created by an audacious move can be disguised, even remedied, by more and greater audacity.
- Any change require injecting more energy than is extracted by the system.
- Once you step into a fight that is not of your own choosing, you lose all initiative.

- Decisions are made based on memory. There are 3 routes: reflex, habits or goals. Influence their memories and you can influence their decisions.  
- the good reason and the real reason.

-->

> *"We catch more flies with honey than vinegar."
-- Proverb*

> *"To combat an adversary, become their friend."  
-- Kevin Kelly*

Charm the enemy to find their weaknesses. Then exploit them.

Hints:

- People’s need for validation and recognition, is the best kind of weakness to exploit. To persuade up, focus on interests; to persuade down focus on emotions.
- Use absence and bait to attract people. It will become a challenge for them to win your affections. The ability to make others come to you is a weapon far more powerful than any tool of aggression. use it with moderation.
- Instead of killing it, charm the snake to fight the other ones. Listen actively and maintain rapport. First they have to trust you. Keep your word and prove your worth, the new guy has always to prove himself.

### On deceiving 

> *"Lies are often much more plausible, more appealing to reason, than reality, since the liar has the great advantage of knowing beforehand what the audience wishes or expects to hear."  
-- Hannah Arendt*

> *"A man is not deceived by others, he deceives himself."  
-- Goethe*

> *"Appear weak when you are strong and strong when you are weak."  
-- Sun Tzu*

If we play by the rules too strictly, we are crushed by those around us who are not so foolish. Fair players on shady markets usually don’t do well on the short term.

By seeming stronger than you are, perhaps through an occasional act that is reckless and bold, you can deter the enemy from attacking you. However deceiving is not lying. Lying is like a nuclear bomb, the effects will be there for a long time. Disappointment destroys trust.

> *"The senses do not deceive; it is the judgment that deceives."

Hints:

- It’s hard to cheat an honest opponent.
- Don’t attribute to malice what you can attribute to incompetence or busyness. So never be mean to anybody that can hurt you by doing nothing.
- The only time you enjoy hearing a lie is when you already know the truth.
- The only thing worth praying is truth.
- If you are in a subordinate position, unpredictability reduces trust.
- Teach no one your tricks or they will be used against you.

Reciprocation is the foundation on which we have evolved: our ancestors learned to share their food and their skills in an honored network of obligation. We feel obliged to repay favors we have received. We feel obliged to make a concession to someone who has made a concession to us.

Accept loss. Surrender conceals great power: lulling the enemy into complacency, it gives you time to recoup, time to undermine, time for revenge.

In order to come back you have to go away. Use this opportunity to re-create yourself. If you didn’t quit anything you would be still playing with toddlers. Every story has an end, but in life every end is just a new beginning. Surrendering to constant reinvention.

### On forgiveness

> *"The only way out of the labyrinth of suffering is to forgive."  
-- John Green*

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it was a poison.

Forgiveness is a process of release so the opposite is a decision to hold onto something. By refusing to forgive someone, we get to cast ourselves as victims, as underdogs, as injured parties. Most important, we get to preserve our status in the conflict — usually, as the person who’s “right.” In reality, we only keep the suffering alive for ourselves. We are the ones we end up punishing.

> *"If you hate a person, you hate something in him that is part of yourself. What isn’t part of ourselves doesn’t disturb us."  
-- Hermann Hesse*

However people who forgive easily are taken for granted.

> *"Once you had put the pieces back together, even though you may look intact, you were never quite the same as you’d been before the fall."
