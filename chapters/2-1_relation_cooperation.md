# 2.1 - On cooperation

## On communication

> *"Knowledge speaks, but wisdom listens."  
-- Jimi Hendrix [1942]*

Speak less and listen more. Talk slow. Be clear. Never mumble. Don’t interrupt. If you can’t be kind, be quiet. The quieter you become. The more you can hear.

> *"A silent man is the best one to listen to." (...)  
"Say a little and say it well." (...)  
"Silence cannot be misquoted."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Give me the gift of a listening heart."  
-- King Solomon [-970]*

> *"A fool is known by his speech, and a wise man by silence."  
-- Pythagoras [-570]*

> *"Know how to listen and you will profit even from those who talk badly."  
-- Plutarch [0046]*

> *"The best way to become boring is to say everything."  
-- Voltaire [1694]*

> *"Don’t talk unless you can improve the silence."  
-- Jorge Luis Borges [1899]*

> *"The most important thing in communication is hearing what isn’t said."  
-- Peter Drucker [1909]*

> *"People don’t listen, they just wait for their turn to talk."  
-- Chuck Palahniuk [1963]*

### How to communicate? 

> *"If you want to be interesting, be interested."  
-- David Ogilvy [1911]*

Be interested to be interesting. Don’t debate at all. Just listen. The point of a conversation is not to win. You don’t need to have an opinion about everything. Get fewer opinions about way fewer things and then interrogate your stronger opinions.

Hints:

- Listen. Mirroring or paraphrase: Repeat the last 1-3 words the person just said as a question or repeat what they just said in your own words. (Yes, it’s that simple). Seek to understand before seeking to be understood. Don’t worry about what you’re going to say next. Speak what’s in your mind, sometimes it backfires, but be real. The best conversationalists are the best listeners. Be interested to be interesting. How do I get them talking about themselves? It gives their brain as much pleasure as food or money. And when they open up, don’t judge..
- Ask questions. Ask a question. Listen to the answer. Respond in the form of a statement. No one is boring. They’re only boring because you haven’t asked the right questions. But you must be curious, asking questions without paying attention is worthless. Making good/unusual questions will make people interested in you. Can be as simple as «what is your favourite book» or as deep as «why is your best friend, your best friend?». It’s hard to fake an answer. “What kind of challenges did you have at work this week? What kind of challenges do you have living in this part of the country? What kinds of challenges do you have raising teenagers?” Everyone has got challenges. It gets people to share what their priorities in life are at that point in time. Talk about your passions instead of your accomplishments. Look for external catalysts as hints for stories and questions. Pick up on often-ignored (but cF\rucially important) nonverbal cues. Best subjects to discuss: ask stuff outside of their expertise where you can add value, travel, sincere compliments or asking for advice.
- Stop trying to impress. Focus on being interested instead of being interesting. Controlling the impression that you make on others takes a large amount of cognitive bandwidth and it will appear as fake. Smile and relax. Warmth comes from smiling while you speak. Popular people always smile more. Calm is largely a matter of slowing your speech down. Treat new aquaintances as old friends. Don’t be stubborn. Make your point and leave it. Let go. Is more productive to say «yes and» instead of «yes but». Get rid of ego and add value. Don’t judge. Know how to lead a conversation and how to go with the conversational flow. Emphasize Similarity, we like people who are like us.
- Keep a journal and write about what you’re looking forward to and excited about in life. That’ll keep ideas on the tip of your tongue, ready to discuss. It’s okay to write the same thing over and over each day.
- People believe in everything, if you whisper it.

> *"The more you say, the less people remember."  
-- François Fénelon [1651]*

> *"Think like a wise man but communicate in the language of the people."  
-- W.B. Yeats [1865]*

> *"A little inaccuracy sometimes saves tons of explanation."  
-- H.H. Munro [1870]*

> *"Two monologues do not make a dialogue."  
-- Mikhail Bakhtin [1895]*

> *"Everyone you meet always asks if you have a career, are married or own a house; as if life was some kind of grocery list. But nobody ever asks if you are happy."  
-- Heath Ledger [1979]*

### How to discord?

<!--
> *"A bore is someone who persists in holding his own views after we have enlightened him with ours."*

- A loucura é a incapacidade de comunicar-se.
-->

> *"Admit when you’re wrong. Shut up when you’re right."  
-- John Gottman [1942]*

Don’t raise your voice. improve your argument.

Listen as you’re wrong. Ask the person trying to convince you of something to explain how it would work. If they can explain why they are correct, you’ll learn something. If they can’t you’ll soften their views. The more we disagree, the more chance there is that at least one of us is right.

> *"Be curious, not judgmental."  
-- Walt Witman [1819]*

> *"Never argue with a fool, onlookers may not be able to tell the difference." (...)  
"Never argue with stupid people, because they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Tact is the ability to tell someone to go to hell in such a way that they look forward to the trip."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"With truly logical people, most arguments are very short and based mainly on differing assumptions."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to tell stories?

> *"Cinema is just life with the boring parts cut out."  
-- Alfred Hitchcock [1899]*

Good stories condense a massive amount of details into a consumable and shareable form. Its primary purpose isn’t accuracy, but entertainment.

> *"To tell a good story, you must reveal a surprise; otherwise is just a report."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

### On public speaking

<!--
- study your audience reaction more than yourself.
-->

> *"Eloquence is logic on fire."  
-- Lyman Beecher [1775]*

Hints:

- You don’t need to answer their questions. You can say whatever you want if it’s interesting but learn when to answer boring on easy to misinterpret questions.
- Agree as much as you can without lieing. Ask questions instead of desagreeing.

> *"If you want to reach a large audience, appeal to idiots."  
-- Arthur Schopenhauer [1788]*

> *"A good speech should be like a woman’s skirt: long enough to cover the subject and short enought o create interest."  
-- Winston Churchill [1874]*

> *"Improvisation is the ability to talk with oneself."  
-- Cecil Taylor [1929]*

> *"Always say less than necessary."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"The secret to public speaking is to speak as if you were alone." (...)  
"The art of conversation is best practiced between three to four people."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On networking

> *"The enemy of excellence is isolation."  
-- Aaron Walker [1910]*

Make networking an habit. Who you know and whether they like you will determine what opportunities you get.

> *It is astonishing what foolish things one can temporarily believe if one thinks too long alone."  
-- John Maynard Keynes [1883]*

> *"Being alone never felt right. Sometimes it felt good, but it never felt right."  
-- Charles Bukowski [1920]*

> *"To develop your intellectual powers at the expense of the social is to retard your own progress to mastery."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

> *"Money is the ultimate network effect." (...)  
"Nothing will attract people to you as much as your values."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### How to network?

> *"Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them, they are waiting for you to send them an email, they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead." (...)  
"When introduced to someone make eye contact and count to 4. You’ll both remember each other."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Be useful, not important. Listen to people, get their goals and help them. It’s not about you, it’s about the impact you have on others.

<!--
- Community of experts (that give you good answers). Critical peers (10 people that make a big difference in your immediate career).
- everyone has an invisible sign hanging from their neck saying, «Make me feel important». Never forget this message when working with people.
- Networking types: advocates a, boomerang b, celebrities c, drainers d  
- Networking types: shark, dolphin, drowner.
- Not what should I do next but who should you speak next?
- What’s the most common question or problem you get asked about? Share the answer.
- Avoid forcing connections.
- Do not beg. Do not call twice. Do not explain yourself. Do not simp. Respect yourself. Do not insult yourself: If they reject you, they are not worthy of your presence.
- shyness costs a fortune
- The first time you meet people, treat them as well as you possibly can – after that, treat them as they treat you.
- When you first meet someone, introduce yourself as a nobody, watch how they treat you, you will gauge their true character, you will understand how they treat others.
- You don’t meet people by accident. There’s always a reason. A lesson or a blessing.
-->

Hints:

- Social adeptness is balancing two seemingly opposing social strategies: competing and cooperating.
- Building new connections is important but it’s even more important to remember the connections that already exist.
- Form relationships with those who seem like they’ll give as much than they take. The best way to get value was to start giving it away even by giving validation.
- You’ll start to live when you can live outside yourself. Being in the moment instead of being in your head.
- Social inadequacy (creepiness) is based on unpredictability. Staring isn’t staring if you’re smiling or if you say hi.
- Field tactics:
	- «Rescue people instead of «cold calling». Include people to gain allies. Become the conduit in your circle — the one who makes sure introductions are made. It really is as simple as asking, “Have you met my friend, Johnny?” Take that responsibility and welcome strangers into your group, and you’ll help everyone feel like they’re part of the conversation. That’s all anyone wants when they’re out – to feel included.
	- Eye contact builds trust. Don’t hide yourself. Don’t wait to start talking. A group or a double might be an easy place to start.
	- Small and open groups. Opening line: "Hi, I’m X and I dont know anybody in this party."  
	- Go to the bar and meet people there or help the hosters to serve food.
	- You should go on after 10 or 15 minutes, think about it as exploring. How to politely end conversations:
		- «Excuse me but I must to talk with somebody that entered the room.»
		- «Excuse me I have to make a phone call.»
		- Human sacrifice... Introduce him and leave.
		- To rude people: «My mum always told me not to speak with strangers.»
- Forget those who forget you. Those who want to stay in your life, will always find a way.

> *"I speak to everyone in the same way, whether he is the garbage man or the president of the university."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

-- Dale Carnegie [1888]*

> *"If you expect magic in every encounter, you’ll find it."  
-- Adam Robinson [1955]*

> *"Millenials who learn the dark Boomer arts of phone calls and eye contact will inherit the earth."  
-- x@molson_hart*

### Why most people don’t like networking?

Handling rejection is hard. Period. We don’t like people that see us in a way that doesn’t resonate with how we see ourselves.

> *"Don’t take it personally when someone turns you down. Assume they are like you: busy, occupied, distracted. Try again later. It’s amazing how often a second try works."

> *"If you can’t sell yourself in 1 sentence you won’t be able to sell yourself in several paragraphs."  
-- Sahil Lavingia [1989]*

Choose truth or your self-mythology will seduce you.

> *"When it comes to the story of our own lives, we’re more like novelists, not journalists. We’re not reading from our confessional journals, but recounting a polished story we’ve rehearsed over years. So a bio becomes a highlight reel of pedigree and accomplishments. Most of the stories we hear about people’s success are nothing more than clever myth-making: a way of reconfiguring their past as they wish to remember it, shaping it into a compelling and effective narrative, and weaponizing it into a personal propaganda tool. That story might be «rags to riches», «rising from the ashes», «one yes after a thousand nos», «crazy till I wasn’t» or any one of the familiar narratives we’ve heard from our heroes."  
-- x@jordanharbinger*

> *"when you want to tell stories, be it startup pitches, or just stories about your experiences, always share them in three points—no more, no less. the human mind & the underlying world gravitates towards threes, look at any industry, typically the equilibrium points lie in threes. there are also numerous other examples that paint this phenomena. it’s a magic number for communication. story tellers rule the world."

> *"The reality is that opportunities have never been more equal than now. @elonmusk and @JeffBezos have the same iPhone you do. They don’t have some better version of an iPhone. They’re eating food that might be marginally better than yours, but it’s basically the same. You might even have a better diet than them. You probably have more time to go to the gym than them. They’re not immortal, and they’re not going to be—most likely, not at this time scale. So you have more youth than them. You have a lot of advantages over them. The wealth gaps are actually much smaller than people think. A lot of that is due to mass production, which comes from specialization, labor, and capitalism. But it’s very easy to overlook that and agitate—because that gets you higher in the status hierarchy with other monkeys. It makes you look like you’re fighting for noble causes and gives you status, which is really what people are craving these days. They’re craving status, not money or wealth. And status is a zero-sum game. So it’s kind of an evil game to play because there have to be losers for every winner. And the only way to win is by crushing somebody else down."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

So the future of consumer products depends on how well you can detect, define, and create what people want before they know it. Traditional market research might be less useful because most people don’t know/can’t articulate what they want—it’s up to the artistically intuitive and psychologically inclined thinkers to find the local religion or patterns of belief and desire in a given market. “Everywhere I go I find a poet has been there before me.” (Freud)

> *"I think the role of the entrepreneur in the world is to find ways to do things better or more efficiently and then try to do that as many times over with the help of other people."  
-- Santiago Nestares [1997]*

Focus on what you can easily give that empowers others.

Validate your business by finding paying clients. If something is worth doing, sales will come easy and dollars will be high. If you have to drag people along kicking and screaming, you’re wasting your time. The more they pay, the more they value it - the consumer votes with his wallet. It’s not about what you know, it’s about who trusts you to solve their problems. Often, it requires the technical skills. Always, it requires the persuasion skills.

First try to sell it. Than build it.

If you build something that people say they’ll pay for and then they don’t then this is problematic, but also normal and doesn’t make you a «wannapreneur». At that point it’s just part of the struggle.

Hints:

- If you have an idea, test it and launch now. It’s called putting out a “minimally viable product” or MVP. Timing is the most important factor in startup success (quick to start but not the first). Team and execution came next. Find the 80/20 solution. Don’t put a bunch of effort to find out there’s no paying demand. 
- The bottleneck for success often is not knowledge of the tools, but lack of understanding of the customer needs. It’s easier when YOU are the customer. Start with something you’re interested in. Don’t worry about the theory, focus on solving the problem.
- Do the math. When evaluating an idea make sure the math scales. E.g. If you’re looking for a restaurant location, look at how many seats, average price of meal, average turnover time, multiply it out. Will even max capacity pay the rent? How many potential sales, how much does it cost to reach them, what is a conversion rate to expect? How much can you produce in an hour, will that ever pay you enough?
- In some complex and mature markets if you start small you my never be able to compete with existent players.
- Create a culture that rewards killing ideas. Nobody gets fired. In fact, people get praised when we kill something, we saved a lot of money.
- Do things manually at first. Don’t scale your team/product until you have built something people want. Only after you are over running your ability to do things manually you do have to worry about automation. 
- Focus on revenue generating activities: if it is not going to earn you money, then don’t do it or outsource them so you have more time to work on your cash flow.
- Deliver a little bit more than expected. That’ll help to get you some recommendations.
- «Fire» nasty, time consuming and time wasting clients.
- Entrepreneurs are more risk averse than general population. Budget pessimistically using the worst case scenario.
- There’s the myth that failure makes you a better entrepreneur. This is true only if you study your failures.

Competition will be lower, because everyone else thought it was too hard. Recruiting good people will be easier, because good people like doing hard things. And when you have better people and less competition, raising capital gets easier, too."

## On selling, negotiation and price

- 0 visibility x 100 skills = 0 opportunities
- Alex says you can even create a worksheet for yourself by asking clear and direct questions like: What am I negotiating? What is my timeline? (This will affect your urgency.) Who are the parties involved? (Asking questions will ensure you are dealing with the decision-maker.) What are my interests in this particular case? when asked for a number: “I’m looking at a few different offers and opportunities — what were you thinking?” When you do get an offer, Alex recommends not counteroffering immediately. “Say thank you for the offer and that you are grateful for the opportunity, and then ask if there is any flexibility on the base. A great closing line: “Based on other opportunities, if you can match this (salary) I can give notice tomorrow.” Alex points out that he wouldn’t hire someone who would simply accept the first offer he gives.
- always negotiate. dont communicate weakness on your negotiation. your first reaction should be no reaction. fight impulse to imediatelly give the answer.

Letter One [Strong Response]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. I truly enjoyed our conversation and feel great about the team and company. [Reiterate passion; set the tone.]
I need to evaluate this based on other opportunities I am looking at and will get back to you shortly. [Display social proof/market validation.] As I am doing that it would be helpful to know if there is any flexibility in the terms? [Put them on the defensive.]
I look forward to your response. [Power close.]

Letter Two [Counteroffer]
Bob, [First name: power play.]
I appreciate the consideration and the offer. [A meaningless courtesy that doesn’t do much, but when it isn’t there, people notice.] I am very excited about the team, the product and the direction of the company. I know I can make a big impact on the organization. [Reiterate passion and set the tone for the back-and-forth. Also a power play.]
Based on other opportunities I am looking at, I feel xxx,xxx,xxx.xx is a fair number for what I can bring to ______. [12%-15% above the offer is optimal. Higher, and you risk insulting them or pricing yourself out of the job. Lower and you could be leaving money on the table.] If you can match that I am ready to sign today and will give my notice tomorrow. [This is the most important part. Present a slam dunk and dare them not to take it. You are coming over the top with enthusiasm; it’s a power play and almost always pays off.]
I look forward to your response. [Power play; leave them with good vibes.]

- First establish a baseline — use Google. Ask if they will match advertised prices from a competitor.
“What is your best out the door price?” “Will you do that -10%?” “If you reach my price, I will buy today.”
“I am on the phone with xxxx; they have this advertised for $xxxx. Can you beat that?” “If I buy here, will you throw in xxxx?” “What if I pay cash?” “Okay, thank you. It’s helpful to know where you stand. I am going to check out a couple of your competitors and will be back if it makes sense.” WALK AWAY.

-- Chuck Palahniuk [1963]*

We’re all in sales. To sell is to deal with objections.

Sales used to be about information asymmetry but now it’s mostly applied persuasion and keeping relationships. Best sellers are now ambiverts. Being recomendend is the best marketing.

Traditional selling: hunters (extroverts)

- Intruding (to get your foot in the door)
- Pitching (to persuade the customer to buy)  
- Persisting (to push until you make the sale)  

Modern selling: farmers (ambiverts and introverts)

- Research (to understand the customer - time spent alone on the web, reading and analyzing information)  
- Listening (to understand individual needs - being patient and quiet while remaining open to new ideas and perspectives)  
- Reacting (to adapt to the identified needs - letting the other person set the pace and the agenda)

### On negotiation
	
<!--
> *"He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation."*

-->

> *"Negotiations are won by whoever cares less."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

You don’t get what you deserve in life, only what you negotiate.

Negotiation establishes the price (exchange rate between money and value). That said, a good negotiation means that you are giving less money (or value) than receiving value (or money).

Hints:

- You can only negotiate with integrous people.
- To negotiate you need to have options.
- To go fast, let the other part go first.
- Tone of voice is a big clue to know with whom we are negotiating. The analytical cold guy is very patient. The assertive guy wants to make it fast. For the accomodator, the relationship is the most important.
- Be playful and smart. Your counter-part will often mirror your good mood.
- Mirroring by repeating the last few words of the other person. It opens up people’s brain. It tests the firmness of what they want.
- Show arbitrage: If they pay X, now they are buying something worth X * Y. That is the only way to sell.
- Saying no: «How am I supposed to do that?». «How» gives people an opportunity to show how smart they are.
- Never negotiate with binary questions: prefer «What can you do?» instead of «Will you do this?»
- Close it: «What’s your best out-the-door price? (...) Can you do X% below that? If you can reach my price, I’ll buy today.»
- The more you take, the more you can give back in meaningless concessions. When people feel they have a choice, they «walk into your trap» that much more easily.
- People buy better versions of themselves, not products.
- Females buy male products. Males don’t buy products targetted to females.
- Instead of details use interesting testimonials that allow people to relate.
- Marketing is a symptom of excess production.

> *"Flattery is the infantry of negotiation."  
-- (Lord Chandos) Hugo von Hofmannsthal [1872]*

> *"People may or may not say what they mean but they always say something designed to get what they want."  
-- David Mamet [1947]*

> *"When asking for help, appeal to people’s self-interest, never to their mercy or gratitude."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

However always strive to achieve a win-win situation. When both sides don’t take what they need from it, the deal may fall. The most dangerous negotiation is the one you don’t know you’re in.

> *"Peace cannot be kept by force. It can only be achieved by understanding."  
-- Albert Einstein [1879]*

> *"You can’t make a good deal with a bad person."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

> *"When negotiating, dont aim for a bigger piece of the pie; aim to create a bigger pie."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"One time a college far away in Ohio, about a 12-hour drive, asked what I would charge to do a two-hour show. I said, «$1500». She said, «Oh, that’s a bit too much. What would you charge to do just a one-hour show?» I said, «$2000». She said, «No, wait, you’ll be performing less, not more!» I said, «Yeah! Exactly! What you’re paying me for is to get there! Once I’m there, playing music is the fun part! If you tell me I have to get back in the van after only an hour, and drive home, then I’m going to charge you more than if you let me play for a couple hours first.» She liked that so much she came up with the $1500."  
-- Derek Sivers [1969]*

> *"Zero-sum games tend towards conflict. Positive-sum games tend towards cooperation."

### On price

<!--
- When money’s free, nobody looks at the price.
-->

> *"Price is what you pay, value is what you get."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Price is a filter. Set it to choose the customers you prefer to work with. If they can’t pay, walk away.

-- Henry David Thoreau [1817]*

> *"Nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

> *"Pay too much for everything. The effort spent getting a deal is only a distraction and attention is your most limited resource."  
-- Allen Tucker [1866]*

> *"When you don’t know how much to pay someone for a particular task, ask them «what would be fair» and their answer usually is."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Pay double and insist on ten times the quality." (...)  
"If it takes an expert to tell you what it’s worth, it isn’t worth anything."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"At some point you begin to define «expensive» in terms of time instead of money."  
-- x@realestatetrent*






## On generosity and incentives

> *"No one has ever become poor by giving."  
-- Anne Frank [1929]*

No one on their deathbed has ever regretted giving too much away.

Hints:

- If you can afford the dinner you can afford the tip.
- Always give best in class: practical luxuries make better gifts than merchandise branded with your company’s logo.
- A low value gift may have the opposite effect.

> *"A bit of fragrance clings to the hand that gives flowers." (...)

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

> *"Attention is the rarest and purest form of generosity."  
-- Simone Weil [1909]*

> *"The miracle is this: the more we share the more we have."  
-- Leonard Nimoy [1931]*

> *"The last time I saw my uncle, I asked how he could be generous, and yet not be taken advantage of or stuck with horrible people. He said that what he’d learned to do was to condition whatever help he was offering on the person taking some tiny step first. Often, it was as simple as «make up a budget for you and your wife to go on a three day getaway, send it to me, and I’ll write you a check». Almost everyone who was just in it for the handouts couldn’t be bothered. My uncle also mixed a lot of his giving with encouraging young people’s talents. He’d hire students who were excited in X, to do X for him in some way. He hired students to take photos, make music, decorate houses, build apps, archive things, paint, and who knows what else. He even hired a student to make memes. This way the students not only got money, but grew in their skills and were excited that someone wanted their work. There were, of course, some rude and uncaring people in his life. But those people didn’t want to spend time with him so there was never really a conflict there." (...)  
"My uncle died suddenly this year. He was unbelievably caring - and not just to family - but to everyone he ever met. His funeral was jam packed with everyone from homeless people to executives of multi-billion dollar companies. I always thought that his ability to always have you, and whatever you had last talked about with him, on his mind at any moment was some kind of supernatural gift. I was surprised to find out at his funeral that he actually kept an excel spreadsheet of everyone he met and what they needed and were going through. He reviewed this constantly. It didn’t lessen his genuine love for everyone, just let him be a little more super human."  
-- hn@danielvf*

### On incentives

> *"In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments, there are consequences."  
-- Robert G. Ingersoll [1833]*

Powerful people give freely, buying influence rather than things.

Hints:

- We learn complex behaviors via continuous reinforcement, in which the desired behavior is reinforced every time it’s performed. After the behaviour is learnt, continuous reinforcement becomes intermitent reinforcement.
- Instead of punishments extingue rewards.
- The people who love you most can care less about how much money you make or what gifts you can send them. What they really want is your presence and attention.
- Punish bad behavior consistently, reward good behavior intermittently

> *"Rewards and punishment is the lowest form of education."  
-- Zhuang Zhou [-369]*

> *"Never take compliments personally. People compliment you because they like you, not because you’re perfect."  
-- x@farshadsarrafi*






## On leadership

<!--
- a autoridade é delegavel mas a responsabilidade n é delegavel
- a leader makes the people next to them better version of themselves.
- A man asked a gardener why his plants grew so beautifully. The gardener said: «I don’t force them to grow. I remove what stops them.»
- convincing vs inspiring leadership
- Lou Holtz has a very pithy mental model for how to evaluate leadership: 1. Can I trust you? 2. Do you care about me? 3. Are you committed to excellence?
- never make a numbers person the leader
- Proactive problem management – Go directly to the source.
- succeful takers are the most visible people in organizations.
- the organization is always modelling the leader. military leader don’t have money to distribute. is way easier. monetary bonus are more a requirement than a motivator now and is negative because people may think they getting unfairly treated.
- There are three keys: honesty, effectiveness, and efficiency.
-->

> *"To lead people walk behind them." (...)  
"A leader is best when people barely know he exists, when his work is done, his aim fulfilled, they will say: we did it ourselves."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

Leaders are team makers. There are no bad teams, only bad leaders.

Being a leader is different from being a boss: it requires to be a manager and a psychotherapist. Leadership is based on emotional intelligence, people don’t follow robots, they follow the strongest person. The secret to motivating people and maintaining their morale is to get them to think less about themselves and more about the group. Leadership is the ability to locate yourself. 

Hints:

- Leaders are embassadors of their teams. They can delegate culture keeping but not culture creation. 
- If you want to lead, simply act with confidence and others around you will pick up on that energy and fall in line. No explicit statements needed. If someone fails to fall in line, either your leadership needs improvement or you need to excise them from your group.
- Best leaders are leaders that grew up in the hierarchy.
- People seek leadership because they want autonomy and influence. Influence is more powerful than money. The reason millionaires are depressed is that they don’t know the difference.

-->

> *"Don’t postpone to tomorrow what other people can do for you today."  
-- Warren Buffett [1930]*

Managing is delegating. A great manager is a great facilitator. His responsability is to make his team better. 

Hints:

- A manager should answer two questions a day: «What is important to accomplish?» and «Where was I uncomfortable the day before?» The speed that you offload your stuff will be the speed of your team.
- Your productivity as a manager is measured as the productivity of your team. Being seated making stuff is not productive. The key principle is putting your team’s productivity first. Remember, you are a communication hub and a multiplier. Think about the things you can delegate vs. the things that only you can do. If you truly work for your people instead of being busy pretending you’re occupied, just tell yourself: what I accomplished today is not yet visible, but it will be. 
- Spend one hour a day communicating to your people and everything will be OK.
- Instead of generalizing and saying «management is useless», it’s more correct to say «bad management is counterproductive». The only reason there’s so many awful managers is that people like you refuse to do the job.

People should feel as part of a tribe. While the tribe is cohese, external threats will pass.

### How to give feedback?

<!--
TEN TIPS ON GIVING FEEDBACK
- Give at least five times more positive feedback than negative.
- Give feedback soon after the behavior you want to respond to.
- Pick the moment when both of you are in the right frame of mind.
- Keep it private. Feedback is not a spectator sport.
- Prepare. Take the time to organize what you want to say.
- Avoid generalities. Cite specific examples.
- Focus on the issue or behavior, not the person.
- Pay attention to body language. Adjust your feedback accordingly.
- Keep it simple. Don’t focus on too many things at once.
- End on a positive note.
-->

> *"The goal is to move everyone up from «unconfident and incompetent» to «confident and competent»."  
-- hn@exelius*

Ask instead of telling.

Continue, or consider. You give feedback that says either «continue doing X» or «consider changing X to make it better». If the delivered work is not good enough give a reason. It’s really simple, fast and actionable.

Hints:

- «Why did you decide to do X in that order?» This creates a dialog, instead of a debate where each side first stakes out positions. Lead your people to discover what you would have suggested. Smart people will get to the same place you were going, or if you are humble enough to listen, you may learn something.
- «Can you take another look at this for XYZ reasons?». This gives the employee ownership of the final deliverable, while still prompting them to deal with problems they overlooked. «Because» is a great motivator.

Giving appropriate feedback makes your juniors feel like what they are doing is important. Pounding directives down or not giving any direction are demotivators. Howewer, don’t do it daily.

### On meetings

> *"The most senior person at a meeting should speak last."  
-- Jeff Bezos [1964]*

Default to «no» for all meetings. Meetings are the death of productivity.

If you can’t say no, schedule for the afternoon and preferably as walking meetings (exercise and sunlight; less pleasantries; more dialogue, less monologue; no slides; end easily by walking back).

Hints:

- Start with an overachieving question: «how can we raise sales by 20%?».
- Tell the bad news promptly. Good news can wait. (Berkshire policy)
- Instead of PowerPoints use «narratives» — four-to-six page memos that employees read and discuss together. (Jeff Bezos)
- People can’t remember more than 3 points from a speech.
- Leave one seat free - for your customer. (Jeff Bezos)
- Do not share your opinion before asking for input from your team. Lower ranked people should speak first.
- Text me when you’re ready for the call but then give me 15 minutes.

> *"If you want the meeting, make it an offer, not an ask."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*






## On mentorship

<!--
+ x@dears_o_n -- You’re a man. Never argue with your father. Shut up or walk away.

- Teach principles, not formulas. Understand, don’t memorize.
- What do I do that is most annoying to you? Say thank you and don’t discuss it. Don’t act on it. JRtruust put it in your mind.
-->

> *"To know the road ahead, ask those coming back."  
-- vox populi*

Feedback from mentors speeds up improvement. Even if you can’t understand the logic behind their wisdom, they’ll show you the door. Don’t take criticism from people that you would never go for advice.

Be generous and share your strengths. Impact the world. When you teach, you do something useful. When you do research, most days you don’t.

### How to find mentors?

> *"When the student is ready the teacher appears. When the student is truly ready the teacher disapeers."  
-- Lao Tzu [-571]*

A paid mentor isn’t a mentor. It’s a salesperson.

Look for the «silver medalist». He has more availability, and sometimes, a better attitude than «the golden child».

### How to mentor your kids?

<!--
+ @naval -- "Children are happy because: 1) They're not self conscious 2) They lack a sense of time pressure 3) They've no goals. The bottom line is they are living from moment to moment, and the mind is not there to interfere in their bliss."

- Absent parent: troubled child
- A father is the one who reveals the truth about life to the kids. A mother is the one who comforts them after hearing it.
- children don’t need a perfect teacher. they need a happy teacher, who’s gonna make them excited to come to school and grow a love for learning.
- Children learn to be kind by experiencing kindness. Not by being told to be kind.
- your child’s behaviour triggers you because deep down inside lives a child that was shamed for behaving the same way.
-->

> *"Teach your children early what you learned late." (...)  
"Teach your children how to think, not what to think."  
-- Richard Feynman [1918]*

Your father is your first mentor.

Don’t tell your kids how to live. Live fully and let them see. Spend only half the money you think you should, but double the time with them.

Prepare the child for the path, not the child for the path.

<!--
> *"My partner teacher does this lovely thing when a student in his class gives him an «I don’t know» response. He simply says, «tell me something you do know that might be helpful»."
> *"Presence rids us of the need for parenting «strategies», many of which are more manipulative than nurturing."  -- Julie Louisson*
> *"Children are natural mimics who act like their parents despite every effort to teach them good manners. Children seldom misquote you. In fact, they usually *repeat word for word what you shouldn’t have said.*

- we become good parents when you start to control yourself instead of controlling your child.
- If you don’t have kids you’ll be the first organism of your direct ancestors to not reproduce since the beggining of life. 
- we are raising weak men and girls who need validation because their father wasn’t there.
- teenagers = treated like children but expected to act like adults
- the letter i wrote my kids after they born: you might think you want an expensive car, fancy watch and a huge car. but i’m telling you, you don’t. what you want is respect and admiration from other people and you think having expensive stuff will bring it. it almost nver does especially from the people you want it.
- ask coolest moment of their week or favorite food.
- monthly photo of your kid room and yearly lenghty video of your kid speaking.
-->

Hints:

- Generosity: «What did you do this week for somebody?»  
- Responsability: «Bedtime at 8.30 and I turn off the light or 9 and you have the responsability to turn off the light?»  
- Self improvement: «Did you give your best today?» «Ask good questions today. In future you’ll be able to know anything you want, anytime you want. So the quality of the questions you learn to ask will be more important than memorized knowledge.»  
- Autority: «Kid: why do I have to do this? You: I was a boy myself. I know why is important.»  
- Money management and healthy habits: pay your son for each mile he rides his bike (with interest on what he decides not to spend).
- Deal with failure: «How did you fail today?» The best gift you can give your children is failure. By treating everything like a major risk, we prevent kids from learning how to judge the truly dangerous, from the simply unfamiliar. Parents prevent their kid from dying but as they get older they shouldn’t prevent them from living.

### How to advance career?

<!--
-->

> *"Learn to sell. Learn to build. If you can do both, you’re unstoppable."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Become the best at one specific thing or very good at two or more things.

Hints:

- You don’t get anywhere, and for more money, sitting in the same seat.
- Happy, smart, and useful. Work smart not harder but hard still. It’s good to be better, but is better to be different.
- Metaknowledge (instead of asking, journal higher hierarchy than you).
- Deliver more value than expected.

-- Cal Newport [1982]*

> *"Oh, this is an easy one. When people say a child is talented they mean he or she is a good learner. But a talented adult is a good do-er. High potential people who fail to make an impact are stuck in child-mode, because that is what they were always praised for."

### How to change career?

> *"The moment you rigidly follow a plan set in your youth, you lock yourself into a position, and the times will ruthlessly pass you by."  
-- Robert Greene [1959]*

You will either pivot or get pivoted.

Avoid the trap of following one set career path, focus on being useful. My passionate interests have changed many times since I graduated college. You are a learning machine, not an occupation. Your work is the greatest mean at your disposal for expressing your social intelligence.

> *"My luggage is always ready."

> *"Jobs are like clothes. There is no "wrong job". There are jobs which fit now."  
-- hn@bergerjac*

> *"My theory: career pivots keep you young/hungry/foolish."  
-- x@ashleymayer*

You make yourself rare by combining two or more relevant «pretty goods». Capitalism rewards things that are both rare and valuable.

- use your transportable soft (e.g. persuasive communication: pitching and change somebody’s opinion, emotional intelligence, ability to read the room, ability to build trust, ability to retain talent) and hard skills (write a pitch, can you change somebody else opinion, make a 2 minute youtube, etc) 
- stuff that looks fun for you and looks like work for others.
- take risks to boost your immune system.

> *"Your income is directly proportional to the need for what you do and your ability to do it."  
-- Jim Rohn [1930]*

> *"Be so good that they cannot ignore you." (...)  
"Career capital is the unique skills that make you rare and valuable."  
-- Cal Newport [1982]*

### Employee or entrepreneur?

> *"Employees who leave to start their own business face a huge risk few ever think about: If the venture fails, they find themselves unwilling to ever go back to being an employee, and many never get back on track. It’s a real risk, and nobody talks about it."  
-- x@realestatetrent*

Employees have no control over their futures. The economy forces all the risk on them.

Hints:

- When you sell your ability to deliver results nobody asks about your skillset. When you sell your time, you need to fit into a role that someone can comprehend and already knows they need.
- Rich people get paid by project and pay by the hour.
- The boss wants the most sophisticated talent he can get, and he doesn’t want to pay anything for it. Every penny he pays, and every second of your life he doesn’t get for it, is a failure in his eyes.

> *"Salaried people are just stepparents. They can be good stepparents but it never matches the biological."

"An entrepreneur without drive is just an unemployed." (...)  
"Earn with your mind, not with your time." (...)  
"You’re never going to get rich renting out your time." (...)  
"Trade money for time, not time for money. You’re going to run out of time first."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### Specialist or generalist?

<!--
- There’s nothing wrong in specialization - it’s how we stay sane. A very workable and easy to understand formula early in your career is specialize in two things; you don’t have to be better at X and better at Y than everyone you meet, you have to be "better at X than anyone who is better at Y" and "better at Y than anyone who is better at X." This is very, very achievable, regardless of how highly competent your local set of peers is.
-->

Hints:

- To be an entrepreneur you need to know a little about a lot of things.
- To be employed, if you pick the right specialization, you’ll do better as a specialist.
- Startups are (by necessity) filled with generalists; big companies are filled with specialists.

> *"Better to have average IQ and know one little tiny niche very well than be a generalist know-it-all genius"  
-- x@realestatetrent*

### How to know your strenghts?

Ask employers why did they asked you for an interview - they will describe your strengths.

> *"Your work speaks only to those on the same wavelenght as you."  
-- Jean Cocteau [1889]*

> *"Our best work is the work we find ourselves doing, when there is no obligation to do so."

### On hiring and being hired

<!--
- Estimativas são Promessas. Promessas devem ser cumpridas. In a nutshell, you can never give an estimate that is "correct". If you could, it would not be an "estimate", it would be a "prediction". Therefore, there is zero correlation between an estimate and the actual outcome.
- hiring questions: sucess history. why did you go that company and why did you left.
- People want freedom to choose their process.
- pro tip: near the end of an interview, tell your interviewers that you want the role
- T ou pi shaped.
- Two valid methods: hiring on culture contribution and hiring on culture matching.
- Your boss doesn’t care how hard you work. They care how easy you make their job.
-->

> *"He who works with his hands is a laborer.  
He who works with his hands and his head is a craftsman.  
He who works with his hands and his head and his heart is an artist."  
-- St. Francis of Assisi [1181]*

Trial most but only hire likable persons that «get shit done».

Your goal should be to «fire» yourself and hire people who are better at your job than you are. Leaders must become masters at finding and hiring talent.

Hints:

- When applying for a job be more of a consultant than an applicant. Don’t do interviews, do discussions.
- Employers are just trying to find somebody they like, that’s what «culture fit» is. Often is not how good you are, you just have to be liked while being sufficiently good. Go into job interviews with a story in mind. All an interviewer really wants to know is if he can spend eight hours a day around you. And people like people like themselves.
- Good interview questions:
	- «Problems you’ve solved and how did you solve them?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What did you get done this week?» (Elon Musk)
	- «What do you own and why?» (Sandy Gottesman, investor)
	- «What do you believe that most people don’t?»
	- «Show me your calendar». A lot of detailed stuff is an implementer. (Codie Sanchez)
	- «How to solve this X problem I have right now?» To detect a fast thinker. (Codie Sanchez)
- Remember that I’d hired them to do things that I could not. As such, they knew their job better than I did. If I could have done it myself, I’d not have had to hire them. Experience is overrated. When hiring, hire for aptitude, train for skills. Most really amazing or great things are done by people doing them for the first time.
- Companies hire for a problem and not general optimizations. Even if they need a generalist. Growing companies are always hiring.
- Decide in advance what your time is worth. Do not let others tell you how much you will be paid. They may make offers, but it is never their decision. It is yours.
- A job search is both a numbers game and a quality game. You can control how many jobs you apply to, and how good your skills and portfolio are.
- You are not paid what you are worth. You are paid what you negotiate for.

That is, people who are both genera lists (highly skilled at a broad set of valuable things—the top of the T) and also experts (among the best in their field within a narrow discipline—the vertical leg of the T) (...) An expert who is too narrow has difficulty collaborating. A generalist who doesn’t go deep enough in a single area ends up on the margins, not really contributing as an individual. Where you choose to be deep should be an area of interest to you and which the market values."

### On resumes

> *"Your real resume is a painful recounting of all your struggles."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Hints:

- Your resume should tell the reader why you more valuable to the company than the next person. You’ll show that with your experience. Tell HOW you accomplished your responsibilities better than the next person. ie. You are responsible for selling cars (so is every other car salesperson). You sold more cars than anyone else in the dealership for six months out of the last year. Which person would you hire.
- There are two skill levels: still learning or confident.

> *"Whatever makes you weird is probably your greatest asset."  
-- Joss Whedon [1964]*

### How to attract and keep talented people?

> *"Everybody wants to hire the best. Few of them actually pay them like they’re the best."  
-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

Respect them. You’ll never respect them if you don’t reward them accordingly.

Hints:

- Use «golden handcuffs» offering your new hires the ability to earn as much as they want, provided that they are earning you even more income in the process. Usually people leave managers, not companies.
- Smart people will not work extremely hard just for money.
- Good employees are not easy to find. It takes some real *chutzpah* to make someone do your work for insufficient compensation while you rake in the big bucks.
- Asking for a raise. Don’t get discouraged if you get a «no». Simply thank them for their time and ask «What specific outcomes would be required to receive this raise within the next 3-6 months?» If they can’t answer this question, you should probably find another employer.

> *"Train employees well enough they could get another job, but treat them well enough so they never want to."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

## On relationships

> *"Perhaps the most counter-intuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others, the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

Focus on what you can give. However, after taking first steps, mirror their behavior. Don’t cross oceans for people who wouldn’t even jump puddles for you.

Hints:

- If you are lonely when you are not alone, you are in bad company.
- If a person is nice to you and to nobody else, that person is not nice.
- Trust and vulnerability are correlated. Don’t hide your feelings from people who show you theirs.
- Supporting helps people grow and builds healthy relationships. Fixing manipulates people and builds resentment and/or co-dependency.
- Sometimes connections grow. Sometimes they stay the same. Sometimes they collapse.
- Choose people that choose you. The end.
- Loyalty is earned, not owed. If they drain your energy, stunt your growth, or disrespect your boundaries, let them go. You weren’t born to carry dead weight. Protect your peace and move forward.
- Never force, don’t beg and don’t chase.
- One day you’re going to miss how much I cared.
- Be careful what you tolerate. You are teaching people how to treat you.
- The more you do for people the less gratitude they show. The more you go out of your way for them to like you, the less appreciative they are of you. too much availability kills your VALUE.

-- Mark Twain [1835]*

> *"Never waste your time trying to explain who you are to people who are committed to misunderstanding you."  
-- Dream Hampton [1971]*

> *"Play long-term games with long-term people. The secret to a happy relationship is two happy people. If you loose somebody for being yourself, then you never had them to begin with. Find a relationship where you, naturally being you, makes the other person happy and viceversa. The worst way to build a relationship is to try to build a relationship. The people you most want to impress can read your intentions." (...)

-- x@rapahelz*

> *"There are only two ways to appreciate or understand how insanely rare a genuine connection with someone truly is: 1) getting older. 2) insanely crazy heartbreak. There are simply no other ways."  
-- x@signulll*






## On family and friends

> *"True friendship can exist only between equals."  
-- Plato [-427]*

Life is meant to be lived in community but don’t settle for a place where you’re tolerated. Go where you’re celebrated.

Be independent from your family but loyal at the same time. Keep your friends for friendship but work with the skilled and competent. Resist the temptation of working with family and friends. Peers are peers, not boss and employee. You will waste your life trying to make those around into who you want them to be.

-- x@falsi1ke*

### How to curate your friends?

> *"Anybody can sympathise with the sufferings of a friend, but it requires a very fine nature to sympathise with a friend’s success."  
-- Oscar Wilde [1854]*

You are the average of your friends.

If you’re always the smartest in the room, you’re in the wrong room. When you enter a workplace, think that you will become like them and not the opposite.

Hints:

- Bad friends will prevent you from having good friends.
- Be suspicious of people who like being owed a favor. Especially if it is not a favor you requested.
- Divide up your life. Spend 33% of your time around people lower than you, you can mentor them. Spend 33% of your time with people that are on your level – your friends and peers. Spend 33% of your time with people that are 10-20 years ahead of you. Those are your mentors.
- Find somebody smarter to teach you, somebody equal to challenge you and somebody less developed that you can teach. Remember that sometimes people wind up in our lives not because we judged them as high-quality individuals, but because of circumstance and nothing more.
- I love Nietzsche’s definition of friendship, which is "people with whom you share one great suffering and one great hope." You can’t be friends unless you hate the same things and worship the same Gods.
- If you look at the people in your circle and don’t get inspired, you don’t have a circle. You have a cage.
- If your absence doesn’t bother them, your presence never mattered.
- Instead of trying to change people, curate them.
- It’s ok to unfollow people in real life. Don’t let your loneliness tempt you to reconnect with toxic people. You wouldn’t drink poison just because you’re thirsty.
- Maintain old friendships. 
- Pay attention to who you’re with when you feel your best.
- Stay way from people who act like a victim in a problem they created.
- Surround yourself with people who challenge you to be better, not people who are enamored with who you already are. People who genuinely want the best for you are very rare and they are usually already wealthy, loved and happy.
- The older you get as a man, the more you understand your father and forgive him for everything.
- The real miracle of Jesus was having 12 close friends in your late 30s.
- There are cycles in life. Do not expect people to level up with you. You are not supposed to keep the same friends forever. The price of growth is outgrowing people. Your successful friends will leave you behind if you don’t level up too.
- You need friends who inspire you to do better, not acquaintances who tell you what you can’t do.
- You only grow apart from people who don’t grow.
- Your girlfriend will get a new boyfriend. Your boss will replace you before your burial. But your mum won’t get another son. Take care of her. Your birthday is for your mom, not you.
- Your single female friends are the most toxic thing in your relationship DUMP them!
- You’re never too old to make a friend. Look for people with the same interests as you. Second step is inviting them to do something. If a buddy calls and needs to get a drink, go. You know someone is a friend when you can go long stretches without talking and the talk is right where we left off.

> *"Brothers love each other when they are equally rich."  
-- vox populi*

> *"Don’t make a man feel too indebted to you. With many persons it is not necessary to do more than overburden them with favours to lose them altogether: they cannot repay you, and so they retire, preferring rather to be enemies than perpetual debtors."  
-- Balthasar Gracian [1601]*

> *"Keep away from people who try to belittle your ambitions. Small people always do that, but the really great make you feel that you too can become great."  
-- Mark Twain [1835]*

"Don’t loan money to a friend unless you are ready to make it a gift."  
-- Kevin Kelly [1952]*

> *"Spend your time in the company of geniuses, sages, children and books."

## On lovers

<!--
> *"If you love a flower don’t pick it up. Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love. So if you love a flower, let it be. Love is not about possession. Love is about appreciation."  -- Osho*
> *"Modern dating is basically learning all about someone until you are no longer attracted to them—sometimes it takes one date, sometimes it takes years."  -- x@signulll*  
> *"Never has anyone done something entirely for others. All love is self-love. Think of those you love: dig deeply and you will see that you do not love them; you love the pleasant sensations that this love produces in you! You love the desire, not the desired." -- Friedrich Nietzsche [1844]* 
> *"Porn has prolonged more marriages than it’s ever destroyed."  -- Rollo Tomasi*
> *"Some advice i gave to my friend: your value as a man should never be reduced to how you look. On dating apps that’s all you are—your height, & your face. It’s an endless police lineup for women to pick from, with nothing else factored in. The apps flattens you into a 2D commodity, judged in milliseconds. If you value yourself in any meaningful way, you should never partake in such a marketplace, ever."  -- x@signulll*
> *"The desire to be loved is the last illusion. Give it up and you’ll be so free."  -- Margaret Atwood*
> *"There are three qualities to look for in a partner: intelligence, energy, and integrity. You need all three. You can’t compromise on any one of them."  -- Naval Ravikant [1974]*
> *"When I think I’m unfairly hated, I try to remember that I’m unfairly loved."  -- R.C. Sproul*
> *"Men dream about virgins. Women dream about monsters. Who’s more perverted?"  -- Rivelino*
> *"Your "loyalty" doesn’t mean anything to her if you can’t get other women. That’s not being loyal, that’s being a loser."  -- Rivelino*

- A man will cry for a woman once in his lifetime. After that, his soul will never allow him to ever trust women (or fully love) ever again.
- Date multiple women, and you’ll never fall in love. Date only one woman, and you’ll lose faith in love.
- I always have this fear that one day you are going to discover that i’m not as great as you once thoght I was.
- I once asked my grandpa: «Why should I not go back to my ex». He replied: «If you see the same tree in the forest twice, it’s because you are lost».
- Men can be easily manipulated by attractive women. Women can be easily manipulated by high status men.
- Men will spend money on women they don’t love, but a woman will never spend money on a man she doesn’t love.
- Porn has ruined men. Social media has ruined women.
- Psycologically the worst feelling is sitting next to a person who means the world you knowing that you men nothing to them.
- she was poetry but he couldn’t read.
- Thank you for not loving me. It forced me to love myself.
-->

> *"We accept the love we think we deserve."  
-- Stephen Chbosky [1970]*

You attract what you are.

Love is what happens to men and women that don’t know each other. Love doesn’t hurt, expectations do. Every person feels loved in a different form.

Hints:

- We fall in love with someone because of how they make us feel about ourselves.
- We’re always looking for somebody that looks for us. First parents, then a lover. Screens give us 100% attention. Tech is a compensation.
- Man’s loyalty is tested when he has everything. Woman’s loyalty is tested when her man has nothing.
- Arguing and insecurity is anti-seductive. Familiarity is the death of seduction.
- Relationships start with «can we talk» to «we need to talk». Once you start disliking someone, everything they do is irritating to you. A dirty dish by the sink can be a big marriage problem.
- Keep separate bank accounts. Spouses should have the freedom and autonomy to buy what they want but only after bills are automatically paid. People value things differently. Having to justify every expense makes you feel like you’re being watched. This breeds resentment. Most marriages end in divorce, most of them over money.

-- Brendan Behan [1923]*

> *"Warriors and worriers.

-- Joyce Benenson [1949]*

### On falling out of love

> *"The love that lasts the longest is the love that is never returned."  
-- W. Somerset Maugham [1874]*

First you see the virtues. Then the flaws. For a long and deep relationship, values must match.

> *"You must love in such a way that the person you love feels free."  
-- Thich Nhat Hanh [1926]*

> *"That’s what careless words do. They make people love you a little less."  
-- Arundhati Roy [1961]*

> *"Both men and women are desperate to revive a broken relationship, to re-create the great love affair they had at the beginning. The difference is that women try to do it while it is ongoing, and men try to do it when it is over."  
-- Zan Perrion [1964]*

> *"Our story has three parts: a beginning, a middle, and an end. And although this is the way all stories unfold, I still can’t believe that ours didn’t go on forever."

-- Naval Ravikant [1974]*

### What women value in men

<!--
- I want a man that sees my demons.
- My man needs to have good social skills. I don’t care how he gets them.
- Women would break down crying if they understood how much more pure men are compared to them.
-->

> *"A gentleman holds my hand. A man pulls my hair. A soulmate will do both."  
-- Alessandra Torre [1978]*

Women like a gentleman who knows when not to be gentle and exhibits grace under pressure.

Hints:

- Girls don’t leave good guys. They leave boring ones. Only a coward is worse than a boring guy. They want neither of them.
- What men think women want: Looks and money. What women actually need: Leadership, humor, honesty, intelligence, resilience, certainty in their actions.
- Men pick loyal girls over successful ones. Girls pick successful men over loyal ones.
- Women respect security, power, and ambition. If you’re broke, you’re tolerated at best and ignored at worst. Without money only mother can love you.
- Every woman wants sex, she just wants it from the best. Women want to be desired, not because it gives them connection, but because it gives them control.

> *"Man is loved mainly because of two virtues: courage first, loyalty second."  
-- Gaius Lucilius [-180]*

> *"Women sometimes forgive a man who forces the opportunity, but never a man who misses one."  
-- Charles de Talleyrand-Perigord [1754]*

> *"Why are women so much more interesting to men than men are to women?"  
-- Virginia Woolf [1882]*

> *"The classical definition of a gentleman: he never insulted anyone unintentionally."  
-- James Crow [1916]*

> *"If you can make a woman laugh, you can make her do anything."  
-- Marilyn Monroe [1926]*

> *"A suit to women is like lingerie to men."  
-- Yves Saint Laurent [1936]*

> *"What do women want? Every woman wants to be in a love story."  
-- Zan Perrion [1964]*

> *"Most women fall in love with the lifestyle of a man, not with the man himself."  
-- x@falsi1ke*

### What men value in women

> *"No matter how plain a woman may be, if truth and honesty are written across her face, she will be beautiful."  
-- Eleanor Roosevelt [1884]*

Trust, style, nice to my family, ambitious and adventurous, must like burritos and road trips. Men hate disrespect more than they love sex.

Hints:

- Young women value themselves based on how much men want to sleep with them, which gives them a false high self valuation. If they valued themselves based on how much men wanted to marry them once they got to know them, they’d have a much more accurate estimation of their worth.
- Men do not care if a woman is an engineer or a doctor. They only care about if she’s loyal, respectful and not a hoe.
- Every boy wants a good girl to be bad just for him. Every girl wants a bad boy to be good just for her.

> *"An old friend of mine, a journalist, once said that paradise on earth was to work all day alone in anticipation of an evening in interesting company."  
-- Ian McEwan [1948]*

> *"A man settles down where he finds peace. Not beauty, not money, not status, but PEACE."

## On marriage

<!--
+ x@giammacool -- Hard times create marriageable women. Marriageable women create good times. Good times create whores. Whores create hard times.
+ x@giammacool -- I was raised by a middle eastern family. In Lebanon only men decide divorce. The way it needs to be.
+ x@giammacool -- If she refuses to sign a prenup she’s planning the wedding and the exit strategy.
+ x@giammacool -- Ladies, If you’re thinking, «I don’t recognize the man I married, I’m not attracted to him anymore», Consider this… Pointing out everything he does wrong daily changes a man. A man who is constantly torn down will naturally pull away. If you’re not building him up daily, you’re setting yourself up for your own downfall, and worse, you’re not protecting your man.
+ x@giammacool -- Nothing is more attractive to a man than your willingness to adopt his last name. Either way, your last name is either your husband’s or your father’s. So, claiming you want to keep your last name isn’t strictly accurate.

- A women is either a 0 or a 1. A hore or a wife material. Dont overcomplicate.
-->

> *"Men marry women with the hope they will never change. Women marry men with the hope they will change. Invariably they are both disappointed."  
-- H. Harwood [1874] & R. Gore-Bro [1893]*

Marry an happy person. Unhappy spouse, unhappy life. People are not avoiding marriage, people are avoiding divorce.

Hints:

- A man would marry a poor woman as long as she’s loyal. A woman would marry a cheating man as long as he’s rich.
- A submissive wife can make a man richer than a career woman.
- «I want to be wanted, but not needed. I should be the one pushing for commitment. I want to have the feeling that I make a great deal, because he's of higher value than me.»
- If you’re waiting for a man to get rich before you take him serious, take note. «Men don’t fall in love when they’re rich».
