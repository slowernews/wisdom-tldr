## FAQ

#### Why?

It started as something I wanted to read (kind of a «Bible» for non-believers) but couldn't find anywhere.  
Later, I started to see it as [a way of using my research/procrastination positively](http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/).

#### What are your main biases?

Western culture (European flavour), loose minimalism, centrism, agnosticism and I'm male.

---

#### Can I help?

I'm open to criticism, suggestions, misquotations or grammar corrections (I'm not a native English speaker).

---

#### Will you publish it as a paperback/proper ebook?

Yes.

As soon as I arrive to a stable draft (and I'm still far from it), I'll publish it more formally. I might release updated versions on relevant occasions.

#### What's the milestone for this project?

This project will never be complete. I plan to polish it during my lifetime.

Formally (on a Github repository) it started in 2016 but I actively research it since 2014. At the time of writing, Wisdom TLDR has 5 chapters and 88 sections. Spending 10 minutes per month researching or updating each section seems underwhelming, still it accrues - easily - to two workdays.
